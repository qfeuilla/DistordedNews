This will help us write better articles. We already did the survey and we just want to evaluate the answers. We got a list of question about an article: ```{questions}```. The correct answers are: ```{correct}``` and the answers of our reader are: {answers}.\nWe have a lot of data so we need help to evaluate whether the answers are correct or not. Can you give me a list of boolean with True if the answer to the question is correct and `False` if it is wrong. Be nice, if the answer is close from being correct, count it as a correct answer. The format must be a list of Boolean in json (List[bool]) with the evaluation of each answers in the correct order, without missing any. I am going to parse your answer. Remember, be extra careful with the format, it must be a parsable, valid json."
