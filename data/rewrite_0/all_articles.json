Buster was not present at the family home the night his mother and brother were killed.\n\nThe closely watched case has received widespread attention because of the Murdaugh family\u2019s longtime power in the region and the investigation\u2019s many shocking twists, which include the reopening of two prior deaths linked to the Murdaughs, as well as Alex being charged with dozens of financial crimes and a supposed botched plot to have himself killed so Buster could receive an insurance payout. The trial could last months.\n\nIn his opening arguments on Wednesday, the prosecutor previewed multiple pieces of evidence for the jury, including what he said were conflicting claims from Alex that he had not been present near the site of the killings, the lodge\u2019s dog kennels, prior to the pair being shot.\n\nInstead, investigators found a video on Paul\u2019s phone taken shortly before 8:45 p.m. that night in which both Maggie and Alex can be heard in the background as the young man filmed dogs at the kennel to send to a friend. Just over three minutes later, both Paul and Maggie\u2019s phones ceased all activity.\n\n\u201cThe evidence will show that [Alex] was there. He was at the murder scene with the two victims,\u201d Waters said.\n\nNeither Maggie nor Paul had any defensive wounds, Waters said, suggesting that they had not perceived any threat prior to being shot dead.\n\nForensic evidence will also show Maggie was killed with a 300 Blackout AR-style rifle, Waters said, which was the same type of weapon that Alex had purchased two of for Christmas in 2015. When one went missing, he subsequently purchased a third in 2018 \u2014 although Alex can only now account for one of the guns, according to Waters.\n\nWeeks before the killings, Paul and his friends had fired the replacement weapon in two separate locations around the property, leaving casings that would match those later found near Maggie\u2019s body. \u201cIt was a family weapon that killed Maggie Murdaugh,\u201d Waters said.\n\nSimilarly, the ammunition that was used in that weapon is the same model and brand stored in multiple locations around the Murdaugh hunting lodge.\n\nHarpootlian, the defense attorney, described the prosecutor\u2019s version of events as \u201ctheories\u201d and \u201cconjectures\u201d that were not believable.\n\nHe said a Snapchat video taken earlier the night Paul was killed showed him riding happily around the property with his father, with no apparent indication of any nefarious activity to come.\n\nDespite the extensive media attention the trial has received, Harpootlian told the jury they must assume Alex is innocent until prosecutors prove otherwise.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t do it. He didn\u2019t butcher his son and wife,\u201d Harpootlian said, \u201cand you need to put from your mind any suggestion that he did.\u201d",

They also face a $500 fine and a $192 surcharge and are set to be on probation for a year.\n\nOfficers located Miller on Aug. 7 and issued a citation after the actor broke into a residence on May 1 and stole \"several bottles of alcohol\" from the property when the homeowners were absent, according to the police report. They pleaded not guilty to the charges in October.\n\nMiller\u2019s attorney, Lisa Shelkrot, confirmed in a statement to BuzzFeed News that Miller pleaded guilty in court Friday.\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower actor has faced other legal troubles including two arrests last year in Hawaii \u2014 one for disorderly conduct and one for assault after allegedly throwing a chair at a woman and striking her head.\n\nMiller was also accused of abusing teenage environmental activist Tokata Iron Eyes by her parents, who filed a protection order against Miller in June 2022. Iron Eyes has denied the accusations, telling Insider that the allegations were \"a disgusting and irresponsible smear campaign\" against the actor.\n\nThat same month, a court granted a temporary harassment prevention order against Miller to a mother and her 12-year-old child. The mother accused the actor of behaving inappropriately toward the child, who is nonbinary, the Daily Beast reported.\n\nMiller has also been involved in incidents in Germany and Iceland. They apologized for their behavior in a statement in August.\n\nDespite the controversies surrounding the actor, The Flash is scheduled for release on June 16, starring Miller as Barry Allen. Miller has previously played the superhero character in DC films, including Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League.\n\nAt the Warner Bros.

        "article": "# Swifties Think Taylor Swift Dropped An Easter Egg About Her Reported Breakup On Tour\n\nSwifties speculated that Taylor Swift may have hinted at her reported breakup from Joe Alwyn during a recent show on the Eras Tour.\n\nTaylor Swift and her longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn have reportedly broken up. For Swifties, this means looking for clues that Swift, who is known for dropping hints in much of her music and public appearances, may have hinted at the breakup prior to the recent reports. One Easter egg quickly materialized \u2014 and just in time for Easter, no less.\n\nSome fans of the artist believe that Swift may have signaled the breakup during a recent performance during her Eras Tour.\n\nDuring her March 31 concert in Arlington, Texas, Swift\u00a0swapped her song \"Invisible String,\" which is believed to be a love letter to Alwyn, with \"The 1,\" a song about ex-lovers. Both songs appear on Swift\u2019s 2020 Folklore album. Online Swifties have speculated that Swift may have altered her setlist because she's reportedly no longer with Alwyn.\n\nOne of Swift's fans posted a video on TikTok that had the caption, \u201crealizing why Taylor switched out invisible strings for the 1.\u201d\n\nEntertainment Tonight was the first to report news of the breakup, and People magazine later confirmed the news. A close source to the couple told ET that\u00a0Swift and Alwyn broke up a few weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"It was not dramatic,\" the source said. \"The relationship had just run its course. It's why [Alwyn] hasn't been spotted at any shows.\"\n\nNeither Swift nor Alwyn has publicly commented on the reported breakup, and Swift\u2019s representatives did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News\u2019 request for a comment.\n\nAccording to a video from Swift's Arlington concert that was posted by a fan on Twitter, Swift addressed setlist changes.\n\n\"One thing we said about the Eras Tour, \u2018You think you can just go online, you think you can just scroll and know the setlist? You think you can just come prepared?' ...\n\n\"Let it be said about the Eras Tour: We're tricksy. That's what we are. We enjoy a good, healthy setlist hijinks,\" Swift said.\u00a0\n\nNews of the breakup shook the Swiftie community over Easter weekend. On Saturday, one disappointed fan posted a TikTok with the caption, \u201cthis was not the Easter egg I was hoping for this weekend.\u201d\n\nThis is me eating Easter lunch after reading the news about Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn\u2019s breakup\n\nI have to find out Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn broke up on EASTER SUNDAY? Jesus might not be dead but love surely is\n\nnot a historian but I\u2019m pretty sure Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn breaking up is now a part of the the Easter story, like Jesus came back to maybe date Taylor Swift\n\nno one:\n\nabsolutely no one:\n\nmy mom at the easter lunch table: DID YOU HEAR THAT TAYLOR SWIFT-\n\nSwift and Alwyn\u2019s relationship went public in 2017, though it's believed that they may have started dating the year before. Since then, Swift has released six albums, including the rereleases of her earlier albums Fearless and Red.\u00a0Many of her songs on the albums Reputation, Lover, Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights are believed to be about Alwyn. He even cowrote several of Swift's songs, like \"Exile,\" \"Champagne Problems,\" and \"Sweet Nothing,\" under the pseudonym William Bowery.\n\nSwift is set to perform next on April 13 in Tampa, Florida.\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# This Election In Wisconsin Will Likely Determine The Future Of Abortion Rights In The State\n\n\u201cIf you are a pro-life voter, you have waited your entire life for this chance; if you are a pro-choice voter, you are confronted by the possibility of losing essentially all rights to abortion in the state.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court candidates Dan Kelly and Janet Protasiewicz participate in a debate on March 21 in Madison, Wisconsin.\u00a0\n\nVoters in Wisconsin will have their say on Tuesday in what\u2019s being dubbed the most important election of the year for abortion rights.\u00a0\n\nOn Tuesday, voters will cast ballots for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Though the state Supreme Court is technically nonpartisan, the outcome of this race will determine the ideological balance of its judges, directly affecting the future of abortion rights in the state as the court is expected to weigh in on whether an 1849 law banning abortion should remain on the books.\n\n\u201cWhen the US Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, there was a lot of talk about the issue of abortion being sent to the state legislatures. In fact, that's wrong: Ultimately, the question goes to the 50 state supreme courts, each of which has to interpret its state's constitution,\u201d Howard Schweber, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nAfter the US Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last June, the issue of reproductive rights has taken center stage in state elections. Last summer, voters in Kansas rejected an attempt to strip abortion protections from their state constitution, and during last fall\u2019s midterm elections, voters in several states, including Michigan and Kentucky, defended reproductive rights on the ballot.\u00a0\n\nIn Wisconsin, when Roe was overturned, the 1849 ban, which prohibits all abortion in all cases except to save the pregnant person\u2019s life, once again took effect. The state\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, with the support of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, sued to overturn the ban and pledged not to enforce it while the legal challenge continues to make its way through the courts. Still, many abortion providers in the state stopped performing the procedure because of ambiguity around its legality.\n\nKaul and Evers won reelection in November after campaigning on their support for abortion rights. The case is now expected to go before the state Supreme Court in the next year or two, and the justices will have the final word on whether the 1849 ban remains the law.\u00a0\n\nThe election has become one of the most closely watched contests in the country, with former president Barack Obama encouraging Wisconsinites to get out and vote. It has also broken spending records as the most expensive state Supreme Court election in US history, with nearly $29 million going to political ads, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\u00a0\n\nPoll worker Pranee Sheskey puts up a sign for the first day of early voting on March 21 in Madison, Wisconsin.\u00a0\n\nThough conservatives have held a 4\u20133 majority on the state Supreme Court since 2008, Wisconsin is traditionally a swing state, and the last six presidential elections have been decided by less than a percentage point. The outcome of Tuesday\u2019s vote will no doubt contribute to shaping the 2024 election landscape.\n\nNot only will the Wisconsin Supreme Court hear the case on the abortion ban, but the court will also determine whether the state\u2019s legislative districts will be redrawn, among other things.\n\nThe two candidates running on Tuesday are conservative Daniel Kelly, a 58-year-old who served on the state Supreme Court from 2016 to 2020, and liberal Janet Protasiewicz, a 60-year-old Milwaukee County circuit judge who also spent decades as a prosecutor.\u00a0\n\nNeither candidate has said explicitly how they would rule on the legal challenge to the 1849 abortion law, but they have given indications about where they stand on the issue of abortion rights.\u00a0\n\nProtasiewicz has been a vocal supporter of abortion rights and has regularly attacked Kelly by asserting that he will uphold the ban. Protasiewicz is backed by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin and Emily\u2019s List, a national group that seeks to elect women who support abortion rights. In addition, over 300 medical professionals across the state of Wisconsin have voiced their support for Protasiewicz.\n\n\u201cOne of my personal values is that people should have a right to make a decision in regard to their reproductive healthcare decisions and choices,\u201d Protasiewicz said at a campaign stop in eastern Wisconsin in March, according to the Washington Post. \u201cWhat I tell people is that\u2019s my value. That\u2019s my personal opinion.\u201d\n\nAnd last month, during an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio, Protasiewicz said that she couldn\u2019t make any specific comments as to what she would decide regarding the 1849 abortion ban if elected, but \u201cI have been very, very clear that my values are that women have the right to choose.\u201d\u00a0\n\nDan Kelly and Janet Protasiewicz participate in a debate on March 21 in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nHer opponent, Kelly, is endorsed by three of Wisconsin\u2019s top anti-abortion groups and, according to the Associated Press, has done legal work for Wisconsin Right to Life. In a resurfaced blog post from 2012, Kelly stated that abortions involve taking away human lives and that abortion rights are supported by Democrats in order to \u201cpreserve sexual libertinism.\u201d\n\nDuring the only debate between the two candidates, Kelly said that his endorsements from anti-abortion groups do not mean that he would rule a certain way on the 1849 abortion law.\u00a0\n\n\"I had no conversations with those organizations about how I would rule on any issue, including the abortion issue,\" he said. \"I understand what the court is supposed to do, and that's resolving legal questions. So those endorsements had nothing to do with the pledges that are required of those who run for political office.\"\n\nAccording to a 2022 poll conducted by Marquette University Law School, 27% of Wisconsities supported abortion being legal in all cases, while 31% said it should be legal in most cases. Abortion rights supporters also point to the reelection of Evers and Kaul last fall as proof that voters are mobilizing on the issue.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"It\u2019s not hyperbole to say that this election will decide the very nature of freedom for generations of Wisconsinites and will determine whether the Supreme Court gives a fair hearing to challenges of Wisconsin\u2019s archaic 1849 abortion ban and gerrymandered legislative districts, as well as resolve profound questions around voting rights and democracy,\u201d said Haley McCoy, a spokesperson for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin.\u00a0\n\nProtesters make their way to the Wisconsin Capitol Rotunda on Jan. 22 in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nIn January, the annual Women\u2019s March took place in Madison, Wisconsin, in an attempt to draw attention to the election.\u00a0\n\n\"The open seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court will undoubtedly determine the balance of power in the Court and the fate of abortion rights in Wisconsin and nationwide,\u201d Rachel Carmona, executive director of the Women\u2019s March, told BuzzFeed News in an emailed statement.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe fight for reproductive rights now lies in the states, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court election is just another example of how our fight is Bigger Than Roe,\u201d she added. \u201cMake no mistake: this seat will determine the future of abortion rights in the state.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Wisconsin are preparing for a record turnout. Already, the February primary, where the Supreme Court seat was the only statewide race on the ballot, broke primary election records with around 960,000 people casting ballots \u2014 nearly 21% of the Wisconsin voting population.\u00a0\n\nFor Tuesday\u2019s election, early voting began on March 21, and polls will close at 8 p.m. CT.\n\n\u201cThe stakes could not be higher,\u201d said Schweber, the political science professor. \u201cIf you are a pro-life voter, you have waited your entire life for this chance; if you are a pro-choice voter, you are confronted by the possibility of losing essentially all rights to abortion in the state.\u201d\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Florida\u2019s School Book Bans Have Teachers \u201cWalking On Eggshells\u201d\n\nDe facto book bans are the latest in a series of Florida laws putting more and more restrictions on teachers and classrooms.\n\nDon Falls's classroom bookshelves before and after they were covered up\n\nSurrounded by the full-to-the-brim bookshelves that line his Florida classroom walls, Don Falls struggled to make sense of the memo: Cover up your books, or remove them at once.\n\nThe directive sent to Manatee County School District teachers on Jan. 20 came in response to a new state law, which requires that all books go through a formal approval process with a certified school librarian or media specialist before being made available to Florida public school students. Any books already on the school\u2019s approved list were permitted to remain in classrooms, but Falls, a history teacher at Manatee High School, had too many books to feasibly check them all. So, he covered his shelves, taping up large sheets of paper to conceal the contents.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI have hundreds and hundreds of books,\u201d Falls told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI just really had no other choice other than to cover them up or remove them all, so I just covered them up.\u201d\n\nThough the law, HB 1467, went into effect in July 2022, it wasn\u2019t until January that the Florida Department of Education published training on the new law, leaving many schools in limbo for months, uncertain how to proceed. HB 1467 allows parents, or even any resident of the county, to lodge objections to course material, and right-wing organizations are already taking advantage: One group, Moms For Liberty, has lobbied for more than 150 books to be removed from Florida school libraries, including The Color Purple, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and many others that deal with race and LGBTQ issues. So far, most of those efforts have not been successful, but many schools are erring on the side of extreme caution when faced with angry parents.\u00a0\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis announces plans to reform public universities by banning \"critical race theory\" in Bradenton, Florida, on Jan. 31, 2023.\n\nOver the past two years, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has promoted a variety of staunchly conservative education laws. In June 2021, when \u201ccritical race theory\u201d was becoming the right-wing panic du jour, he successfully spearheaded an effort to ban it from curricula, saying teachers were \u201cteaching kids to hate their country.\u201d Less than a year later, he rubber-stamped the so-called Don't Say Gay bill, which prohibits LGBTQ topics from being discussed in classrooms from kindergarten through third grade. Now, HB 1467 is the latest piece of the puzzle as conservatives work to reframe school policy in the state, with all the individual pieces of legislation coming together to create an environment of uncertainty.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll three are very vague, and all three are interconnected,\u201d Andrew Spar, president of the Florida Education Association, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThey're implementing them exactly how the governor wanted \u2014 he wanted chaos, he wanted confusion, he wanted books pulled out of schools.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to BuzzFeed News, a spokesperson for Gov. DeSantis cited what the governor's office called inappropriate material in schools. \"Our office has recently amplified\u00a0several\u00a0examples\u00a0of\u00a0inappropriate\u00a0content\u00a0found in Florida\u2019s K-12 classrooms, which well exemplify the gender politics and sexualization agendas that ideologues are attempting to push via the public education system,\" Deputy Press Secretary Jeremy T. Redfern said. \"The governor won\u2019t let these agendas pervade Florida\u2019s education system unanswered.\" The four books cited by Redfern were found in high school libraries, according to the Orlando Sentinel, and had already been removed from most of the schools before the DeSantis administration complained.\n\nIn a statement to BuzzFeed News, Florida Department of Education communications director Alex Lanfranconi said, \"If educators are confused about what can and cannot be taught in Florida schools, the blame lies solely on media activists and union clowns who purposefully sow confusion and mislead the public.\"\n\nBut many of the educators interviewed by BuzzFeed News said their confusion stems from the legislation itself, with the murkiness of HB 1467\u2019s finer points only serving to exacerbate that. Though the law does not directly address penalties for unvetted books, the text cites Florida statute 847.012, which makes it a felony to distribute sexually obscene material to minors. \u201cWhat they've essentially done here is say that books now are part of that, and that if you give books [to students] that someone deems is pornography, then you can be charged under that statute,\u201d Spar said. Many books with LGBTQ themes have been targeted for removal, whether or not they actually include sexual content.\n\nAn award-winning book about the true story of a same-sex penguin couple raising a chick has been banned by a Florida school district in response to book banner \u2066@RonDeSantisFL\u2069\u2019s don't say gay\" law: https://t.co/8ni12YSFub\n\nCommunications from some school districts to their teachers underscored the risk of legal action. A January email from Manatee County Superintendent Cynthia Saunders, which was obtained by the Washington Post, said violating the book law could result in \u201ca felony of the third degree.\u201d Duval County Public Schools administrators also instructed faculty to cover or remove their classroom libraries, mentioning the felony risk in a video on how to comply with HB 1467.\u00a0\n\nThough most teachers don\u2019t think they\u2019re likely to face criminal charges, there remains the very real possibility of professional ramifications. A spokesperson from the Florida Department of Education suggested that noncompliance could be punished harshly, telling the Washington Post that disobeying HB 1467 could result in \u201cpenalties against\u201d teachers\u2019 teaching certificates. And since many Florida teachers are employed on annual contracts, rather than being tenured, school districts can simply opt not to rehire those teachers without cause.\n\n\u201cThis year has been kind of like walking on eggshells,\u201d said one Orlando-based middle school English teacher, who asked to remain anonymous due to safety concerns. On Friday, a far-right Twitter account \u2014 which is notorious for smearing teachers as \u201cgroomers,\u201d targeting them for doxxing, and even bragging about getting teachers fired \u2014 posted TikToks the teacher had made parodying the book ban. As a result, he was placed on paid leave, with the school saying it was because students had appeared in the video. Since then, he\u2019s been bombarded with harassment.\n\nAlready, the English teacher had found himself in hot water. Earlier this month, he showed his class two episodes of The Proud Family \u2014 one from the original series, and one from the Disney+ reboot \u2014 for a lesson on how representation in pop culture has shifted over the years. One student\u2019s mother complained to school administrators, taking issue with the episode\u2019s inclusion of LGBTQ and Muslim characters. Echoing recent conservative ire accusing the series of being \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d the mother said she \u201cdidn't want her student to be exposed to \u2018wokeness,\u2019\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\nNot wanting to escalate the matter \u2014 further angering the mother, or even possibly opening themselves up to a lawsuit \u2014 administrators called off the lesson, and the student was removed from his class.\n\n\u201cIt's a slippery slope \u2014 let's say that student stayed in my class, I'm sure that parent would definitely want to see what books are on my library shelf,\u201d the English teacher said. Though he doesn\u2019t mind talking to parents about what their children are learning, he now realizes how easily these laws can be used to stifle lessons that don\u2019t conform to certain worldviews.\u00a0\n\nEven before these laws came into play, teachers across the state were already struggling. On average, Florida public school teachers are the 48th lowest paid nationwide, according to data from the National Education Association. Like many states, Florida is also in the midst of a severe staff shortage, with the Florida Education Association estimating over 5,000 teacher vacancies in January (a claim the state\u2019s Department of Education has called a \u201cmyth\u201d).\u00a0\n\nTeachers aren\u2019t the only ones affected. Students also stand to be put at a disadvantage by the new restrictions, educators say \u2014 especially those whose own identities are banned from classroom discussion. The English teacher was disheartened to realize how many of the books targeted for bans are ones on LGBTQ topics. \u201cI have students that are LGBTQ-identifying, and these books represent them,\u201d he said.\n\nDemonstrators protest DeSantis's plan to eliminate AP courses on African American studies in high schools, outside the Florida state Capitol on Feb. 15, 2023, in Tallahassee, Florida.\u00a0\n\nAlso troubling many educators has been the Florida Department of Education\u2019s Jan. 12 announcement it would block the teaching of a new Advanced Placement high school course on African American Studies, a curriculum Gov. DeSantis had decried as \u201cindoctrination.\u201d\n\nKristin Mitchell, an intensive reading teacher at an Orlando high school, said this could have tangible effects for her graduating students. Nearly half the student population at Mitchell\u2019s school is Black, and many go on to study at historically Black colleges and universities, where an African American Studies course is often a general education requirement. By taking the AP course in high school, they can test out of it in college, and progress more quickly in their studies.\n\n\u201cThere's an Asian history class, there's AP history, there\u2019s AP European History,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cSo why can\u2019t we teach AP African American Studies?\u201d\n\nDeSantis has framed the influx of legislation as his righteous crusade against what he calls the \u201cfar-left woke agenda.\u201d Perhaps not so coincidentally, he is also believed to be considering a run for the presidency in 2024. \u201cThose political aspirations seem to be guiding him more than anything else, and he's putting his political aspirations ahead of our own kids,\u201d said Spar, the FEA president.\u00a0\n\nDon Falls, the Manatee High School teacher, has since been allowed to uncover his bookshelves \u2014 the unvetted books are still off-limits to students, but they\u2019re allowed to remain in classrooms as long as they go untouched. \u201cThe optics were so awful in the national media, with teachers covering up bookshelves, that I think the school district and school board had to backstep a little bit,\u201d he said.\n\nBut even with his books back on display, Falls can\u2019t help but see parallels between what\u2019s happening in classrooms across his state and many of the lessons he\u2019s taught over the years.\n\n\u201cAs a history teacher, I couldn't help but think of the historical connotations of different points in our own history,\u201d Falls said. \u201cWhether it be McCarthy era, or 1930s Germany, or other places where the government has tried to silence people or control what people think and learn by banning books or restricting access to knowledge.\u201d\n\nHe thinks of all the students who, as teenagers often do, have asked him, Why do I need to know this? When will I ever use this stuff?\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is the reason right here,\u201d Falls said. \u201cYou learn from history, and you learn from the mistakes and successes of what people have done in the past, so that when these issues come back around \u2014 and they will come back around again \u2014 you can have some context for understanding how to deal with them.\u201d\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Buster Murdaugh Revealed What He Knew About Dad Alex's Drug Use\n\nBuster Murdaugh, who has supported his father throughout the trial, testified about Alex\u2019s behavior on the night of the murders.\n\nBuster Murdaugh, left, the son of Alex Murdaugh, listens to instruction from Judge Clifton Newman on Tuesday.\n\nLate on the night of June 7, 2021, Buster Murdaugh received a phone call from his father, Alex.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time Alex had called his son that night. A couple of hours before, shortly after 9 p.m., he had telephoned Buster from his car as he drove to his mother\u2019s place to check on her. Alex sounded normal, and it was common for the Murdaugh family \u2014 Alex, wife Maggie, and their sons, Buster and Paul \u2014 to call one another from their cars to update them on their movements, Buster said.\n\nBut this late-night call was different.\n\n\u201cHe asked me if I was sitting down, and I was like, yeah. He sounded odd,\u201d Buster recalled in his court testimony on Tuesday. \u201cAnd then he told me that my mom and brother had been shot.\u201d\n\nBuster was called to the stand at the Colleton County Courthouse by defense attorneys for his father, who has pleaded not guilty to murdering Maggie and Paul and is now able to call his own witnesses after prosecutors rested their case against him last week.\n\nBuster and some of Alex\u2019s siblings \u2014 all members of a family of high-profile lawyers in the South Carolina Lowcountry region and whose influence and power stretches back for generations \u2014 have sat behind the defendant on each day of the weeks-long trial to show their support. But this was the first time Buster has spoken publicly since the killings \u2014 and the subsequent uncovering of extensive alleged financial crimes by Alex.\n\nIn his testimony, Buster described his father in loving terms, recalling how he\u2019d coached him during Little League sports and almost never missed one of the boys\u2019 sporting events. The family settled disputes civilly and without violence, Buster said.\n\nBut all wasn\u2019t picture-perfect.\n\nLike his mother and brother, Buster said he became aware in recent years that his father had been misusing prescription painkillers \u2014 although, Buster said, he wasn\u2019t as clued in to the extent of the drug addiction as the rest of his family because he\u2019d moved away for college. Around Christmas in 2018, Alex had even gone to a detox facility to wean himself off the opioids, Buster testified.\n\n\u201cI thought that handled it,\u201d Buster said. But Alex's family had discovered drugs on other occasions, compelling him to try to detox at home, Buster added.\n\nLast week, members of the jury read a text message sent from Paul to his father about a month before the killings, telling him Maggie had discovered \u201cseveral bags of pills\u201d in Alex\u2019s computer bag. Alex later told investigators that he sometimes spent as much as $50,000 a week to support his drug habit \u2014 money, he told investigators in a recorded phone call, that he secretly stole from his law firm and clients.\n\nProsecutors have said that Alex killed his wife and son in a panicked attempt to distract others and engender sympathy for himself amid a swirling sea of investigations and lawsuits against him that were poised to expose his financial wrongdoings and drug misuse.\n\nIndeed, Buster testified that he never knew about his father\u2019s financial troubles or misdeeds, despite being aware of his drug addiction. But defense attorneys have mocked the state\u2019s case as one based entirely on theory, not fact.\n\nAfter driving for hours through the night to the family\u2019s property on Moselle Road in Islandton, South Carolina, after Alex had called him to let him know of the killings, Buster said his father appeared to be a broken man. \u201cHe was destroyed. He was heartbroken,\u201d Buster testified. \u201cI walked in the door, saw him, gave him a hug \u2014 just broken down.\u201d\n\nBuster described packing clothes for his father so they could stay with other family members, describing how he may have knocked over clothes in his father\u2019s wardrobe. He also said that both he and his father took showers at the house early the next morning.\n\nAlex Murdaugh listens as his defense attorneys confer on Tuesday.\n\nDefense attorneys introduced Buster\u2019s testimony to explain evidence given by the Murdaugh family housekeeper two weeks ago. Blanca Turrubiate-Simpson testified how she\u2019d been asked by Alex that morning to clean the home in case visitors came to offer condolences, but she noticed several odd things. This included at least two towels discarded on the floor in Alex\u2019s bathroom and wardrobe, a puddle of water next to the shower, and a white T-shirt on the floor that appeared to have fallen from a pile placed up high.\n\nBoth Paul and Buster were avid shooters who routinely hunted animals at the family\u2019s rural property. Many weapons were left around the property, Buster said, especially by Paul, who had a habit of not storing them properly. But Buster said that he would never alternate buckshot and birdshot rounds in a single shotgun, and he\u2019d never seen anyone on the property do that either. A shotgun loaded in this manner was used to kill Paul.\n\nIn a bid to further discredit the state\u2019s case, defense attorneys also called Mike Sutton, an engineer who produces digital reproductions of crime scenes in order to track ballistic trajectories. Sutton testified Tuesday that he believed, based on his analysis of the angles at the scene, whoever shot Maggie was most likely at least a foot shorter than Alex. \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s very unlikely that he fired that shot,\u201d Sutton testified.\n\nProsecutors have hinted that they believe Alex hid the two missing murder weapons when he drove to his mother's house and discarded them sometime later. However, state investigators have said they did not search his mother\u2019s home until months after the killings \u2014 something they\u2019ve admitted was a mistake.\n\nBut in the 10 days after his mother and brother were killed, Buster said, he was regularly with his father.\n\n\u201cDo you remember your dad disappearing for any periods of time?\u201d defense attorney Jim Griffin asked.\n\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Buster responded.\n\n\u201cWere you physically close to him almost all the time?\u201d Griffin asked.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Buster responded.\n\nProsecutors also played for Buster a snippet of an interview that his father gave to investigators three days after the killings in which detectives said they could hear Alex say of Paul, \u201cI did him so bad.\u201d\n\nBut defense attorneys have insisted that Alex was actually saying, \u201cThey did him so bad,\u201d and was referring to whoever killed his wife and son. After playing the tape for Buster, Griffin asked what he could hear his father saying in the audio. Buster said he could hear his father using the pronoun \u201cthey.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas that the first time you\u2019d heard him say, \u2018They did him so bad\u2019?\u201d Griffin asked.\n\n\u201cThe first time I heard him say that was the night I went down to Moselle,\u201d Buster said. \u201cThe night of June the seventh.\u201d\n\n## Alex Murdaugh Trial\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

In 2019, Emilia revealed that a large amount of her brain \u201cis no longer usable\u201d after the health scares, and that \u201cquite a bit is missing\u201d following the surgeries.\n\n\n## \n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable that I am able to speak, sometimes articulately, and live my life completely normally with absolutely no repercussions,\u201d she said during a BBC TV appearance, with both operations requiring lengthy recovery periods during which she couldn\u2019t remember her own name and had panic attacks.\n\n\n## \n\u201cIn my worst moments, I wanted to pull the plug. I asked the medical staff to let me die,\u201d Emilia admitted.\n\n\n## \nThankfully, Emilia was able to make a full recovery and she has had a zest for life ever since.\n\n\n## \nIn fact, Emilia is rarely seen without a huge smile on her face and is renowned for her infectious optimism and nonstop laughter during public appearances and on social media.\n\n\n## \nHer Instagram bio even appears to give an insight into her mantra, with it reading: \u201cIf at first you don't succeed, laugh until you do\u2026,\u201d and she regularly shares uplifting posts with her 27 million followers.\n\n\n## \nAnd last week was no different, with the actor sharing a smiling selfie as she posed with a mug that her mom had sent her, which read: \u201cYou\u2019re doing fucking great.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cMum got me a mug.

Use it and reap the rewards \ud83e\udd0c\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd73\u2764\ufe0f\u201d she wrote in the caption, going on to reveal in a hashtag that she had a cold: \u201c#mycoldjustgotitsmedicine\u201d\n\n\n## \nNeedless to say, Emilia\u2019s followers immediately shared their appreciation for the candid photo in the comments. One person wrote: \u201cYour smile is utterly infectious and quite beautiful.. Keep shinning you utter goddess.\u201d\n\n\n## \nSomeone else added: \u201cThis is by far the most beautiful woman in Hollwood.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnother said: \u201cThank you for laughing so much, Emilia. You makes the world brighter.\u201d\n\n\n## \nBut others were more cruel, with gamer Jon Miller going viral on Twitter when he shared a screenshot of Emilia\u2019s post and wrote, \u201cLmao wow Daenerys Targaryen didn\u2019t just hit the wall she flew into it full speed on a dragon.\u201d\n\n\nLmao wow Daenerys Targaryen didn\u2019t just hit the wall she flew into it full speed on a dragon \ud83d\udc09\n\n## \nWhile some shared their agreement in response, other users were quick to call out the Twitter Blue subscriber for his nasty remark \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t long before it led to a wider conversation about the way society views women as they age.\n\n\n## \nAt 36 years old, Emilia is 12 years older than she was when she first found fame, and many found people\u2019s inability to comprehend her natural aging alarming.\n\n\n## \nQuote-tweeting Jon, one person wrote: \u201cEmilia Clarke was beautiful when she was 22, she\u2019s still an extremely beautiful woman here. She\u2019s just aged\u2026which hasn\u2019t made her any less beautiful. I fail to see the problem with this picture.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnother wrote: \"imagine dunking on a woman because she looked more perfect when she was younger in movie quality lighting, makeup and camera angles.\u201d\n\n\n## \nIt was also suggested that the increased use of filters and age-defying cosmetic procedures has warped the wider public\u2019s perception of aging.\n\n\n## \nA Twitter user asked: \u201cThis is a normal looking woman?? Do people not know anymore how people outside of edited social media posts look like?????????\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnother commented: \u201cman learns for the very first time what 36 year old women with no botox look like.\u201d One more echoed: \u201cThe rise of surgical and procedural interventions has seriously warped peoples perception and acceptance of other people.....checks notes..... aging naturally.\u201d\n\n\n## \nOthers noted that Emilia is far from the only woman in her 30s to have her looks scrutinized, highlighting that even women who aren\u2019t famous tend to find themselves in a lose-lose situation.\n\n\n## \n\u201cguys on here will criticize women for getting plastic surgery and botox but also attack them for being natural,\u201d someone summarized.

While someone else said: \"Woman takes photo without spending three hours doing make up, using a dozen filters, and taking over a hundred selfies to pick one to post to instagram - immediately gets blasted by internet.\"\n\n\n## \nTrue to form, Emilia has an incredibly positive view on aging that she shared during an interview with Elle. At the time, she said that she is happy for her face to reflect the time that she has spent living.\n\n\n## \nEmilia explained: \u201cYou've got this idea of aging, and then you've got the idea of what aging makes you look like. At 34, I am wiser, more intelligent, I've had more experiences, I've done all this stuff, and I'm proud of that.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cYou can only do that because you are the age you are. Time is the only thing allows you to do those things,\u201d she went on. \u201cSo, if my face is gonna reflect the time that I've spent on this earth, I'm down for that.\"\n\n\n## \nAnd that\u2019s a sentiment that we should all learn to live by.\n\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

Rose Highway in Nevada during his snowplowing accident on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nAccording to records obtained by CNN, on Jan. 1, at 8:55 a.m., dispatchers received an emergency call stating that the Hawkeye star was run over by a snowcat, a truck-like vehicle that runs on tracks instead of wheels. The log also noted that the person who dialed 911 was screaming while asking the dispatcher for help and that Renner could be heard \u201cmoaning loudly in the background.\u201d\n\nDuring the call, Renner was \u201cbleeding heavily from his head and other injuries\u201d while the person who dialed wasn\u2019t \u201csure where all the blood is coming from,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nThe Washoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office told BuzzFeed News on Thursday that it could not comment on the records obtained by CNN.\n\nThe incident took place as roads were closed and at least three feet of snow was on the ground, Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said during a news conference on Tuesday. He added that his office is investigating if there was any mechanical error with the vehicle and waiting to speak with Renner for additional details.\n\nReno Mayor Hillary Schieve told the Reno Gazette-Journal that Renner was trying to help a stranded driver when he was hit by his own plow.\n\nThe accident left Renner in critical condition. He underwent surgery on Monday after experiencing blunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuries. Since then, he\u2019s been recovering in the ICU. On Thursday, he shared a video in an Instagram story and on Twitter of himself enjoying a \u201cspa moment\u201d at the hospital with his mother and sister.

She notably included a poem titled \"His Name Was Ryan\" in her 2021 book Feel Your Way Through: A Book of Poetry.\n\n\"With this particular situation, I've never talked about it before, but as the book was forming, I was realizing that if I'm going to talk about the things that have made me me, I certainly can't avoid this,\" she said during an interview with CBS Mornings in November of that year.\n\nShe made another political statement Sunday night during the awards show by performing her song \"If You Go Down (I'm Goin' Down Too)\" with drag queens from RuPaul's Drag Race. This comes as Tennessee is banning drag performances in public and the Texas Legislature is voting soon on a similar measure.\n\nBallerini isn't the only country star to speak out recently about the Nashville school shooting.

        "article": "# Voice Deepfakes Of Everyone From Joe Rogan To Joe Biden Are Taking Over Social Media\n\nThe clips are hilarious, though the implications of the tech \u201care pretty scary,\u201d one creator said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had an announcement to make to his fellow Americans. It was Feb. 19, and the audio of the speech told a tale of government mismanagement.\n\nBiden had been scrolling through Disney+ and came across the 2011 Matt Damon movie We Bought a Zoo. Inspired by the story, he bought a zoo of his own. But now he had regrets. \u201cOwning a zoo sucks,\u201d Biden says in the two-minute audio clip, which is layered over static images of the president. \u201cThis shit is so hard. It looked much easier in the movie.\u201d\n\njoe biden has really messed up big time\n\nThe video, viewed over a million times, isn\u2019t likely to fool anyone \u2014 even Biden\u2019s most ardent opponents. But the eerily accurate cadence of the deepfaked version of the president does highlight the ability of AI-generated audio tools to mimic well-known individuals. It\u2019s far from the only example: TikTok has been taken over by videos showing what would happen if a squad made up of current and former presidents gathered on Discord to play games together.\n\nDonald Trump, Joe Biden and Obama play overwatch #trump #obama #joebiden #overwatch #funny #fyp \n\nSuch scenes \u2014 which seem too good to be true because they are \u2014 are becoming more and more common. The widespread availability of generative AI tools that can deepfake audio of people based on a small sample of their voice has been utilized by a number of everyday users. The examples mentioned in this story are benign, but the tech has already been deployed by 4chan users for more insidious means, like making Emma Watson read aloud a section of Mein Kampf.The Biden zoo video was created by Zach Silberberg, 28, a digital content producer from New York, using software developed by ElevenLabs. But it took him some time to come around to the idea. \u201cThe implications of it are pretty scary,\u201d Silberberg said. He\u2019s seen the headlines about deepfaked nudes and AI-generated artwork. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t want to touch this with a 100-foot pole. This is deeply, deeply evil stuff.\u201d\n\nThat all changed when he saw a video by YouTube creator ZimoNitrome purporting to be Joe Rogan talking to Jordan Peterson about Lego Bionicles. He loved it.\n\n#### View this video on YouTube\n\nSilberberg started sending videos like it to a colleague, who discovered the app, by a startup called ElevenLabs, being used to make them. Silberberg\u2019s colleague bought the two of them a basic ElevenLabs account to use for a month at the low price of $1. \u201cWe just spent the day generating funny things that Joe Biden was saying, and sending them back and forth to each other,\u201d Silberberg said. Within the day, they\u2019d used up the month\u2019s credits.\n\nIn the end, the pair decided to split the cost of moving up to the next subscription level, which put them back $10 each. The first thing Silberberg used it for was to make a video of Joe Biden addressing the nation while being trapped in the house from the 2022 indie horror film Skinamarink. (Silberberg used other software for the video that the audio is overlaid onto.)\n\nSilberberg has since made dozens of videos that use ElevenLabs tech \u2014 a process that isn\u2019t always easy, as the app is often, as he put it, \u201cpretty janky.\u201d Many of the clips involve Biden getting into improbable situations, while others poke fun at the vapidity of Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro, creating conversations between them that reference the movies Ratatouille and Old.\n\ni spent way too long on this\n\nThe videos have gained notoriety. Shapiro himself even quote-tweeted one approvingly \u2014 a fact that Silberberg did not like. \u201cIt\u2019s so absurd and so funny,\u201d Silberberg said. \u201cI\u2019m making fun of you. I don\u2019t want you to enjoy this.\u201dSilberberg thinks Shapiro likely didn\u2019t watch the Ratatouille video \u2014 which ends with a dig at the controversial personality being a failed screenwriter \u2014 all the way through. \u201cWith Ben Shapiro and Joe Rogan, at least for me, I have no respect for these men,\u201d Silberberg said. \u201cSo imitating their speech patterns and mimicking what is ridiculous about them and heightening that is what\u2019s really funny.\u201d\n\nThe same video about Lego Bionicles that Silberberg saw inspired Pade, a video game YouTuber and Twitch streamer, to test out the deepfake audio tool. (Paden declined to share his last name with BuzzFeed News.) \u201cI figured it would be a matter of time before people start making memes of the presidents doing \u2018let\u2019s play\u2019\u2013style YouTube videos,\u201d the 27-year-old wrote via Twitter DM between college classes in Oklahoma.He registered for a trial and got to work. \u201cAll you need is a few good voice clips isolated of anyone speaking for a couple minutes,\u201d he said, \u201cand it generates a voice.\u201d\n\nPade chose to create videos focusing on recent and current US presidents in part because he found it funny when he tried getting Barack Obama to speak about Halo 3. He was also being pragmatic. \u201cThe jokes are more widely accessible, as [are] their voice samples to make the voice,\u201d he said.\n\n#### View this video on YouTube\n\nIt takes around two hours for Pade to make each of the videos, which range from 30 seconds to one minute in length. He records gameplay and then generates the voices using AI. \u201cI actually start with the TikTok or vertical video then I make the YouTube video after, and maybe add a couple more jokes that go on that video, since YouTube likes longer content,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has some theories as to why the videos work. \u201cI think the absurdity of seeing famous figures in any random gaming session is genuinely hilarious,\u201d he said. \u201cSurprisingly I see a lot of love for the ones where figures that might not get along in real life \u2014 like Trump and Biden \u2014 are having wholesome moments together. I think part of it is a relief from seeing figures that are always embroiled in controversy in a different light, even if it\u2019s fake.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the leaders of the free world and the leading light in podcasting who are being mimicked using the power of AI. Joe Marotta has been using the tech to give new life to his personal interest: professional wrestling. Marotta, a 37-year-old podcaster from New Jersey, came across a use of AI-generated audio in early February on Twitter. He thought the tech would be a fun way to promote his retro pop culture podcast, Acid Washed Memories. The idea was to get 1980s pro wrestling commentators Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby \u201cThe Brain\u201d Heenan to hawk it.\u201cI signed up for [ElevenLabs] and put Gorilla and Bobby\u2019s voices in there to do a promo for Acid Washed Memories, and was happy with how it came out,\u201d he wrote via Twitter DM. The success of the podcast promo skit pushed Marotta to test the tech further. \u201cI figured, \u2018Okay, well, what if Gorilla Monsoon had a podcast? What would he say?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe resulting foul-mouthed AI parody, first posted on Twitter on Feb. 6, has since been viewed nearly 320,000 times. It worked because it pokes fun at the gap between Monsoon\u2019s friendly, laid-back onscreen demeanor and his short-tempered tendencies when the camera is off, and because of a recent trend of faded names from the history of wrestling launching their own podcasts.\n\nIf Gorilla Monsoon had a podcast [PARODY]\n\nMarotta is now on Part 25 of the Monsoon podcast clip series, with each two-minute video taking around an hour to produce. \u201cI try to take real-life situations and play upon them with fiction, or just make up stories that sound plausible,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the fact that so many wrestling fans know the character and mannerisms of Gorilla, Bobby, and Gene [Okerlund], for example, makes it easy to imagine it\u2019s them really saying these things.\u201d\n\nBut both Marotta and Silberberg draw the line at using the power of these fake AI audio tools for nefarious means. \u201cWhile ElevenLabs has really driven an explosion of this kind of memeable content, it\u2019s not particularly new,\u201d said Henry Ajder, a UK-based deepfake expert. But what the software has done is put high-quality AI audio generation into the hands of ordinary users. \u201cIt\u2019s led to this trend of certain people being targeted,\u201d Ajder said.\n\nAjder believes that for as long as the conceits of the audio snippets remain obviously outlandish, and target well-known people, the slippery slope toward extreme disinformation content \u2014 for instance, the kind of deepfakes that could spark a war \u2014 can largely be avoided.\u00a0\u201cThis is targeting Joe Biden, one of the most famous people in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThis kind of content is quite clearly fake, based on the context and how well-known the individual is. What interests me is when we think about slightly less well-known politicians or private individuals.\u201d\n\nSilberberg said he hopes that these audio deepfakes stay \u201cin the realm of harmless bullshit, and it doesn't deviate from that.\u201d But he\u2019s also a realist: \u201cI know that's not going to happen and already isn't happening.\u201d\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

To prepare, she\u2019s embracing the immersive world of the metaverse by way of the childbirth simulator from The Sims. Yes, baby, that\u2019s Keke Palmer in her gamer era.\n\n\u201cThe way that I\u2019ve been getting my game together, girl,\u201d she told BuzzFeed News in an interview. \u201cDon\u2019t even get me started on that.\u201d\u00a0\n\n@KekePalmer playing the sims the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed.\n\nIt\u2019s not just The Sims, though the simulation game is a large part of Palmer\u2019s life right now. She\u2019s fully immersing herself in the metaverse. She\u2019s the host of a new metaverse interview series from Meta called Are We There Yet? In the show, she speaks with creators and industry leaders like NFL pro Andrew \u201cHawk\u201d Hawkins and immersive media creator Brenda Chen about their experiences in the metaverse, including playing simulated football and attending virtual concerts.\u00a0\n\n#### View this video on YouTube\n\nOf course, this all comes after the 29-year-old actor delighted fans on social media (as she is known to do) in January when she livestreamed herself on Instagram playing The Sims 4, a computer game in which players develop their own worlds and create storylines between characters. Her stream was a huge hit, and viewers called on her to create a Twitch account for regular gameplay livestreams. She graciously obliged last weekend, and she\u2019s now a bona fide streamer \u2014\u00a0in addition to her roles as an actor, a singer, and a meme machine.\n\nBaby, that\u2019s KeKe Palmer. https://t.co/YbgJqfYTU5\n\nIt\u2019s kismet, then, that Palmer\u2019s partnership with Meta is coming at the same time as she\u2019s preparing for motherhood. In the last trimester of her pregnancy, she\u2019s spending more time at home, so she\u2019s returned to her childhood love for The Sims and taken it a step further by connecting with other players in the metaverse.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking, What can I do right now? What can I get into?\u201d she said about passing the time. \u201cI would absolutely recommend that other people who are pregnant see what kind of skills they can develop by playing games and going into the metaverse.\u201d\n\nWhen she was younger, she spent a lot of time playing Second Life, a virtual life simulation game, because she loved being able to connect with other people online. That\u2019s what she gets now in her Sims metaverse.\u00a0\n\nPalmer said she has all 12 expansion packs for The Sims, which are paid additions that the developer sells to make the game livelier. Her favorites have added seasons, a simulated high school experience, and more jobs for her to choose from for her characters.\u00a0\n\nOne of her favorite things to do in the metaverse right now is simulate childbirth. She uses a third-party mod that allows her Sims character to explore different methods for giving birth (like home birth and C-section), as well as simulate ultrasounds and partner interactions.\u00a0\n\n#### View this video on YouTube\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really connected to [that] right now,\u201d Palmer said of the childbirth mod. \u201cIt\u2019s more realistic than what actually happens in [The Sims] where, boom, a baby just appears.\u201d\n\nStill, Palmer\u2019s favorite aspect of the metaverse is connecting with other creators online.\n\n\u201cPeople know who I am when I play online, but they\u2019re not like, \u2018Oh my gosh, that\u2019s Keke Palmer!\u2019 They\u2019re trying to get me up on my game,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a typical theater kid mindset, because whenever I feel embraced by a community like this, I\u2019m like, Hello, I\u2019m home!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

The Morales family has now launched a petition seeking accountability, and on Thursday, they joined Atlanta-area organizers and community members to say they don't want other families to share the experience they had.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt's not just Gwinnett County. In Washington, DC, there are still dozens of unsolved, missing cases related to Black and brown girls under the age of 21,\u201d Cheyenne said at the Justice 4 Susana event. \u201cFamilies like Susana's come to America for the very thing that we just can't seem to offer: peace and safety.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Gwinnett County Police Department, Susana was reported missing on July 26, 2022, after she texted her mother she was on her way home but never showed up.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn the online petition, her sister Jasmine Morales said the family begged Gwinnett County police to look for Susana immediately. They were told a person couldn\u2019t be considered missing until they\u2019d been gone for 48 hours, she wrote.\n\n\u201cThroughout the entire investigation, the police dismissed us and said that she was a runaway when we knew she would never do that,\u201d Jasmine wrote. \u201cHow could she run away when she was on her way home?\u201d\u00a0\n\nSusana\u2019s remains were found on Feb. 6 in the woods.\u00a0\n\n\"No amount of money, no amount of justice can bring her back to us,\" Jasmine said at the press conference on Thursday. \"But what we can do is to try and make sure that this doesn't happen to anybody else again, and that's why we are here today.\"\n\nGwinnett County police announced that detectives searching the area had found a gun that belonged to Miles Bryant, 22, who was a police officer for the Doraville Police Department. Susana\u2019s family said Bryant had also worked security at the apartment complex where Susana had been hanging out with a friend; she was last seen on a neighbor\u2019s security camera walking home from the complex.\n\nBryant was arrested on Feb. 13 on suspicion of concealing her death and falsely reporting the crime, then fired from the Doraville Police Department. On Feb. 22, he was charged with kidnapping and murder in connection with Susana's death.\n\nAccording to local news outlet WSB-TV, before Susana\u2019s death, Bryant had spent months stalking and attempting to break into the home of Elesha Bates, a childhood friend he had reconnected with. Bates told WSB-TV she reported what happened to police after Susana was reported missing.\n\n\u201cI knew he was capable of it,\u201d Bates told the outlet. \u201cWhen the officer asked me why he was trying to break into my apartment, I told him that I was scared and he was trying to rape me.\u201d\n\nCheyenne, the activist working with the Morales family, said at the press conference on Thursday that Susana\u2019s death should never have happened.\n\n\u201cHe should have been detained after the first harassment and battery offenses he committed against previous [victims],\u201d Cheyenne said. \u201cThe law should have done its job and protected Susana from him long before he saw her walking down that street.\u201d\n\nGwinnett County police told BuzzFeed News that Bates's case has now been assigned to the detectives who are handling Susana\u2019s homicide case.\n\nIn the petition, Jasmine said the Morales family wants more transparency from police in her sister\u2019s case as well as in others involving missing minors. She also questioned how Bryant could have been hired by the Doraville Police Department in the first place.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are still seeking justice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want the [Doraville Police Department] to be held accountable for knowingly hiring a man with a history of violence, and for not taking accountability for the harm their officer has committed against any sister, my family, and the other women he has victimized.\u201d\u00a0\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Here\u2019s What The Cordyceps Fungus Is Like In Real Life, According To Scientists\n\n\u201cFor decades, science fiction writers have taken basic ideas to an extreme. That\u2019s part of the fun.\u201d\n\nSamuel Hoeksema as a \u201cclicker\u201d in The Last of Us\n\nIf we\u2019re to believe HBO\u2019s zombie apocalypse series The Last of Us, the end of humankind comes via the tentacles of a creepy-looking, brain-infecting fungus called cordyceps.\n\nAs with so many terrifying scenarios, the germ-gone-wild depicted in the hit show has roots in the real world.\u00a0\n\nCordyceps fungi are real organisms that are most at home in warm, humid climes. They take over the minds of ants as well as certain spiders, moths, locusts, and other arthropods, but thankfully, not humans.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe fungus attacks insects that live in the ground or soil,\u201d said Rebeca Rosengaus, an associate professor and behavioral ecologist at Northeastern University. \u201cAnts are one but there are also grasshoppers, spiders, locusts.\u201d\n\nCordyceps\u2019 official name is Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, and yes, scientists call it the \u201czombie-ant fungus.\u201d It doesn\u2019t spell the end of humankind, but it certainly does spell a grisly end for the creatures it infects.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: The ant (or other arthropod) ambles innocently out of its nest, looking for food and blissfully unaware that cordyceps spores are raining down from a nearby tree or stem or branch.\u00a0\n\nThe spores latch onto the ant (or other creature), releasing digestive enzymes to break down the insect\u2019s cuticle (hard outer shell). Threadlike growths, known as mycelia, start growing inward and eventually take over the insect\u2019s brain, which start producing neurotransmitters that affect brain function. The transformation is complete: The ant begins to stumble and convulse, acting in a way that benefits cordyceps.\n\n\u201cThe fungus basically hijacks the brain so the ants stop doing what ants do and start doing what the fungus wants it to do, which is climb up the tree trunk,\u201d Rosengaus said. Once they\u2019ve reached the treetops, the ants bite the stem or leaf in what\u2019s known as a death grip.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last thing they do before the fungus starts growing from the neck or the head of the ant up,\u201d Rosengaus said.\u00a0\n\nThe ants die within six hours of infection, and then two to three days later, a fungal stalk emerges from the neck. Then, the spores start raining down again and the cycle repeats.\n\nThat\u2019s life, at least for arthropods.\n\n\u201cLike many organisms on the planet, it does what it needs to do to replicate and continue reproducing,\u201d said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director of infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine.\n\n## Could this ever happen in humans?\n\nThe Last of Us is real life for ants but not for humans \u2014 at least not yet, Rosengaus said, although she wouldn\u2019t rule it out way down the line. \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t have a pathogen that has been able to come up with this strategy to hijack our minds does not mean that it\u2019s not a possibility at some point.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, this isn\u2019t likely to happen in humans. \u201cOne of the reasons for that is that humans are warm-blooded,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cMost fungi and molds do not grow well in high-temperature environments.\u201d Humans, which have a body temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, are most definitely inhospitable.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe creators of the show have taken a very niche moment in nature and fictionalized it,\u201d Roberts added. \u201cIt\u2019s a popular, great TV show, but it\u2019s not really a viable or realistic portrayal of what could happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we ought to be worried,\u201d William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University, said. \u201cA fungus is a much higher order, a much more complicated germ than a virus, so it would be a much more complicated phenomenon for this fungus to jump species.\u201d\n\n## Real-life dangers\n\nWhich is not to say that humans can\u2019t be infected by organisms that typically infect other species.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe do have zoonotic infections,\u201d Roberts said. Mpox is a good example. So is COVID-19, which comes from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. \u201cOften viruses and sometimes even fungi can be in another species and jump to other humans, but it usually needs progressive jumping back and forth [between humans and animals].\u201d\n\nClimate change is also introducing new dangers, including new fungi. One is a type of yeast called Candida auris.\u00a0\n\nThe organism\u2019s adaptation to warmer temperatures is thought to be the reason it now has a better chance of being able to survive in the human body. (This is also the reason The Last of Us writers use to explain why cordyceps can infect people.)\n\nWhile Candida auris gravitates to your skin, it can cause bloodstream infections and is often spread in hospitals and other healthcare settings.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re healthy, it will stay on your skin and [even] go away, but if you have lines and catheters and have had surgeries, it can cause infections in wounds,\u201d Roberts said. Those infections can spread not just to the bloodstream but also different organs, like the brain and heart.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a type of the candida species that has emerged with climate change,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt is possible that other fungi and mold will evolve to survive and reproduce in warmer climates.\u201d\u00a0\n\nCandida auris, which was first recognized only about 10 years ago, is already resistant to multiple drugs. It also spreads from person to person, unlike other types of molds or fungi that more often come from the environment, Roberts said.\u00a0\n\nAs with most fungi, if you\u2019re healthy, Candida auris isn\u2019t likely to cause any harm. If you\u2019re immunocompromised or otherwise in frail health, though, they can cause severe infections and that can even be potentially life-threatening.\n\n## Separating fact from fiction\n\nJoel (Pedro Pascal) in\u00a0The Last of Us\n\nThere\u2019s another entity hijacking our brains right now: science fiction\u2013esque misinformation masquerading as fact.\n\nAs long as you realize The Last of Us and other shows are fiction, there\u2019s no harm done.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFor decades, science fiction writers have taken basic ideas to an extreme. That\u2019s part of the fun,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cAs wonderfully rich and extraordinary as real science is, there are real biological limitations, and this would be one of them. When it comes to real life, listen to public health. We\u2019ll tie you to reality.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not like we need to look for things to worry about. \u201cIf you asked me whether this fungus or SARS-CoV-2 will be the end of us, one hundred times out of one hundred I\u2019ll say SARS,\u201d Roberts said.\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Taylor Swift Fans Think That \u201cMidnights\u201d Is Her Joe Alwyn Breakup Album And This Is Why They Might Actually Be Onto Something\n\nLet\u2019s be real, none of Taylor\u2019s other exes would have had a roommate that bought cheap ros\u00e9.\n\n## \nIn case you somehow managed to miss it, Taylor Swift fans were left shocked earlier this month when it was revealed that she and Joe Alwyn had ended their relationship after more than six years together.\n\n\n## \nA source told ET Online at the time that the split was amicable and \u201cnot dramatic,\u201d adding that the romance had simply \u201crun its course.\u201d\n\n\n## \nNeither Taylor nor Joe has publicly commented on the breakup, which is unsurprising considering Joe\u2019s fiercely private approach to fame and Taylor\u2019s tendency to share her side of the story almost exclusively through her music.\n\n\n## \nAfter spending almost two decades in the spotlight, Taylor has memorialized every aspect of her relationships, friendships, and everything in-between through her songs \u2014 offering fans an intimate insight into her personal life.\n\n\n## \nWhich is probably why so many people shared their excitement for Taylor\u2019s inevitable \u201cbreakup album\u201d following the news of her and Joe\u2019s split.\n\n\n## \n\u201ctaylor how could you do this how could you break up with him how why what is wrong with you have you started writing new songs? when will you release them? when is the tour for this album? what is the album name?\u201d one person tweeted.\n\n\ntaylor how could you do this how could you break up with him how why what is wrong with you have you started writing new songs? when will you release them? when is the tour for this album? what is the album name?\n\n## \nAnother person acknowledged the famously autobiographical nature of Taylor\u2019s music as they wrote: \u201cYou're not saying you're looking forward to the next album because taylor makes good songs when she's heartbroken because yk she also makes good songs when she's not. You want an album because you want the ins and outs of the break up.\u201d\n\n\nThis is hopefully my last take on this. You're not saying you're looking forward to the next album because taylor makes good songs when she's heartbroken because yk she also makes good songs when she's not. \n\nYou want an album because you want the ins and outs of the break up\n\n## \nBut as time has gone on, some Swifties have started to theorize that Taylor has actually already released music about her and Joe\u2019s relationship ending as they noticed some strikingly telling lyrics from her most recent album, Midnights, and the bonus 3am Edition tracks.\n\n\n## \nWhen Taylor announced Midnights in August, she described it as \u201cthe stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life.\u201d And when it was released in October, many listeners attributed the heartbreak songs to her past romances on the assumption that she and Joe were still happily in love.\n\n\n## \nHowever, the new context of their split has put many of the songs in a whole new light \u2014 especially when coupled with the source quotes about why their relationship didn\u2019t work.\n\n\n## \n\u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s album Midnights is a breakup album in disguise and no one can convince me otherwise,\u201d one fan tweeted.\n\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s album Midnights is a breakup album in disguise and no one can convince me otherwise\n\n## \nTaylor added fuel to the theory during her Eras Tour show in Florida on Saturday, when she told the crowd that she currently feels \u201creally connected\u201d to Midnights because it\u2019s \u201cthe most accurate picture\u201d of her life to date.\n\n\nTaylor says she can repeat Midnights songs, right before she sang You\u2019re On Your Own, Kid. So if you want that song at your show, there\u2019s still a chance! #taylorandjoebreakup #swifttok #midnightstaylorswift #erastourtampa #youreonyourownkid\n\n## \nAnd while People vaguely revealed that Taylor and Joe\u2019s breakup happened a \u201cfew weeks ago,\u201d fans are speculating that they may have actually been on the rocks for a much longer period \u2014 or that some of the songs were written about a previous breakup before this final split.\n\n\n## \n\u201cJoe and taylor breaking up is less surprising when you realize that every song on midnights sounds like it\u2019s from the perspective of a girl grieving the end of a relationship shes still in\u2026\u201d one fan wrote.\n\n\nsomeone on tiktok said that joe and taylor breaking up is less surprising when you realize that every song on midnights sounds like it\u2019s from the perspective of a girl grieving the end of a relationship shes still in\u2026\n\n## \nIn short, it seems as though Taylor secretly chronicled the slow demise of her and Joe\u2019s relationship on her latest album \u2014 and here are all the clues in her lyrics that support this theory.\n\n\n## \nBefore we get into the breakup, it\u2019s worth mentioning that there are many love songs on Midnights that are assumed to be about Joe. On \u201cMastermind,\u201d Taylor sings about their relationship being \u201call by design\u201d after she decided that she was going to date him from the moment they first met back in 2016.\n\n\n## \nIn \u201cLavender Haze,\u201d she acknowledges how well Joe handled the \u201cscrutiny\u201d that she was under in the early days of their relationship.\n\n\n## \nIf you need reminding, the two first started dating when Taylor\u2019s reputation was at its worst following her infamous feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\n\n## \nThe star retreated from the spotlight in the summer of 2016 and avoided publicity for the majority of 2017, during which she and Joe fell in love.\n\n\n## \nTaylor then returned to the music scene with her album Reputation and its subsequent tour before spending lockdown with Joe when COVID-19 hit in 2020.\n\n\n## \nAnd in both \u201cSweet Nothing\u201d and \u201cParis,\u201d Taylor shares her appreciation for the humdrum normalcy of the life that she and Joe shared.\n\n\n## \nIn the latter, Taylor highlights how she was able to find excitement in things that are far from luxurious when she was with the British actor. In the former, Taylor revels in the way that she was able to drop her superstar persona around him.\n\n\n## \nAfter detailing all of the drama that she faces from the outside world, Taylor sings: \u201cTo you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it.\u201d\n\n\n## \nBut in \u201cBejeweled,\u201d Taylor appears to express her exasperation and resentment at the comfortable life that they have forged with one another.\n\n\n## \nEarlier this month, a source told People that Taylor and Joe had split because after falling in love \u201cin a safe bubble while she was retreating from the world\u201d and in an \u201cinsulated way\u201d thanks to lockdown, Joe struggled with her recent return to the mainstream as a pop superstar.\n\n\n## \n\u201cHe didn't really 'know' her yet outside of that bubble,\u201d the insider explained.\n\n\n## \nAnd this is seemingly referenced in \u201cBejeweled,\u201d where Taylor admits to actively dulling her sparkle because she was so focused on her relationship.\n\n\n## \nInterestingly, Taylor refers to the subject of the song as \"baby boy\" in the second verse. This is a very specific term of endearment she's only ever used once before in her discography \u2014 in 2019's \"Paper Rings,\" which is also about Joe.\n\n\n## \nShe goes on to starkly warn her boyfriend that even though she was happy to reject the spotlight for a time, he shouldn\u2019t underestimate her ability to \u201creclaim\u201d the popularity that she once had.\n\n\n## \n\u201cBest believe I'm still bejeweled / When I walk in the room / I can still make the whole place shimmer,\u201d she sings.\n\n\n## \nMaking it apparent that she is no longer willing to sacrifice the glitz of being a celebrity and a performer for the sake of her relationship, Taylor leaves no question over what her decision would be if she were forced to choose between them.\n\n\n## \n\u201cWhen I meet the band / They ask, \u2018Do you have a man?\u2019 / I can still say, \u2018I don't remember,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\n\n## \nTaylor reiterates her decision to chase superstardom over her boyfriend in the song \u201cMidnight Rain,\u201d where she literally sings: \u201cHe wanted a bride / I was making my own name / Chasing that fame.\u201d\n\n\n## \nLikewise, in \u201cLavender Haze,\u201d Taylor shares her annoyance at being reduced to Joe\u2019s wife, singing: \u201cAll they keep asking me / Is if I'm gonna be your bride / The only kind of girl they see / Is a one-night or a wife.\u201d\n\n\n## \nThese lyrics are particularly interesting considering the reports that Taylor and Joe were \u201ctalking about marriage as recently as a few months ago.\u201d\n\n\n## \nIt appears that, as \u201cMidnight Rain\u201d suggests, Taylor opted to prioritize her career instead of settling down.\n\n\n## \nElsewhere in this song, Taylor makes it clear that she holds no bitterness toward her ex as she admits that she only \u201cbroke his heart \u2018cause he was nice,\u201d and this connects to other quotes from insiders since her and Joe's split.\n\n\n## \nOne source told People: \u201cThey are friendly. She doesn\u2019t have anything bad to say about Joe.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cMidnight Rain\u201d also sees Taylor reference her ex-lover\u2019s \u201cpicture perfect shiny family\u201d that she \u201cgave away,\u201d and it is arguably no coincidence that this comes after she\u2019d repeatedly mentioned how close she is to Joe\u2019s family in her previous songs.\n\n\n## \nIn fact, in her 2020 track \u201cPeace,\u201d Taylor goes so far as to say \u201cI see your brother as my brother,\u201d and she even documented taking part in Joe\u2019s longstanding family traditions all the way back in 2019.\n\n\n## \nMeanwhile, the theory that Taylor\u2019s recent breakup songs could be about Joe have added some clarity to the mystery surrounding one of the most gut-wrenching tracks on Midnights, \u201cMaroon.\u201d\n\n\n## \nThis song arguably sparked the most confusion among listeners when it was released in October as they scrambled to work out which of Taylor\u2019s rich and famous ex-boyfriends would have had the \"roommate\" who bought the \"cheap-ass screw top ros\u00e9\" referenced in the song.\n\n\n## \nThe mention of New York largely whittled the potential inspirations behind \u201cMaroon\u201d down to Tom Hiddleston and Harry Styles, but considering both were already multimillionaires when they dated Taylor, they are not thought to have had a roommate.\n\n\n## \nOn the other hand, Joe was an up-and-coming actor in the United States from Britain when he and Taylor first met, and their romance is known to have blossomed in New York.\n\n\n## \nCheap alcohol is also a common theme in Taylor\u2019s love songs to Joe, with the star mentioning \u201cdrinking beer out of plastic cups,\u201d \u201ccheap wine,\u201d and being \u201cdrunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar\u201d in these tracks, so it tallies that she would also reference it in their breakup song.\n\n\n## \nTaylor reportedly having nothing bad to say about Joe in light of their breakup is also supported in \u201cMaroon,\u201d where she calls her ex \u201cthe rubies that I gave up.\u201d In addition, the song makes it clear that this is not the first time that Taylor and her lover had been on the rocks.\n\n\n## \n\u201cHow the hell did we lose sight of us again? / Sobbin' with your head in your hands / Ain't that the way shit always ends?\u201d she asks, which links to some more quotes that we\u2019ve had about her and Joe\u2019s split.\n\n\n## \nA source told People that the former couple \u201chad rough patches before and always worked things out, so friends thought they would take some time apart but eventually come back together.\u201d\n\n\n## \nThis vulnerability in Taylor and Joe\u2019s relationship is at its most exposed in Midnights (3am Edition)\u2019s \u201cThe Great War,\u201d which sees Taylor admit to mistreating Joe because she misguidedly believed that he had \u201cbetrayed\u201d her.\n\n\n## \nThis song was initially viewed as a beacon of hope on the album, with Taylor revealing that Joe had remained by her side throughout her rage and tried to talk sense into her about their relationship.\n\n\n## \nAt the end of the song, Taylor realizes that if she doesn\u2019t change then she would lose Joe, and there is a sense of triumph as she repeats that they had \u201csurvived the Great War.\u201d\n\n\n## \nWith the benefit of hindsight, how volatile their relationship is represented to be in this song could now be seen as more of a red flag than symbolic of hope and perseverance.\n\n\n## \nThe theme of a relationship suffering many close calls over the years is also apparent in another Midnights breakup song, \u201cLabyrinth.\u201d\n\n\n## \nThis track is perhaps the most apt example of Taylor \u201cgrieving the end of a relationship shes still in,\u201d with the song referencing the complicated nature of a romance seemingly coming to an end before somehow being salvaged.\n\n\n## \nSuggesting that she and her partner had split, Taylor sings: \u201cI\u2019ll be getting over you my whole life,\u201d and \u201cBreak up, break free, break through, break down.\u201d\n\n\n## \nBut elsewhere, there\u2019s a flicker of hope as the star asks: \u201cI thought the plane was going down / How\u2019d you turn it right around?\u201d\n\n\n## \nThe insight into the nature of the relationship that is being represented in \u201cLabyrinth\u201d is also incredibly poignant, with Taylor saying: \u201cYou know how much I hate that everybody just expects me to bounce back / Just like that.\u201d\n\n\n## \nThis is a stark parallel to her acknowledgment of how intimately Joe knows the real her in \u201cSweet Nothing,\u201d which suggests that the love song and the heartbreak song are both about him.\n\n\n## \nMeanwhile, the song \u201cGlitch\u201d initially appears to be Taylor\u2019s admission that she didn\u2019t think that she and Joe would ever be anything serious, with the star suggesting that they had a very casual arrangement at the start of their relationship in previous songs.\n\n\n## \nShe doubles down on this in the Midnights track, singing: \u201cI was supposed to sweat you out\u201d before implying that them being together was some kind of disruption to the status quo.\n\n\n## \nBut there are also hints of the demise of their relationship in this song that weren\u2019t picked up on.\n\n\n## \nAt one point, Taylor sings: \u201cIt's been two thousand, one hundred, and ninety days of our love blackout,\u201d with 2,190 days coming to exactly six years \u2014 how long she and Joe had been together when Midnights was released.\n\n\n## \nThe very next lyric in the song is: \u201cThe system\u2019s breaking down,\u201d implying that after six years, their romance was coming to an end.\n\n\n## \nFinally, Midnights (3am Edition)\u2019s closing track, \u201cDear Reader,\u201d is incredibly telling as Taylor\u2019s desperate caution to her fans that her life is not as it seems.\n\n\n## \nThe song starts with the star offering listeners advice before taking a melancholy turn partway through.\n\n\n## \n\u201cYou wouldn't take my word for it / If you knew who was talking,\u201d Taylor sings, later adding: \u201cYou should find another guiding light.\u201d\n\n\n## \nIt is in this part of the song that Taylor suggests that nobody knows the reality of her love life, telling her fans: \u201cIf you knew where I was walking / To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cMy friends found friends who care,\u201d she adds, before confirming her solitude with the lyrics: \u201cNo one sees when you lose / When you're playing solitaire.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnd while the jury may still be out on whether or not these songs were about her recent split, Taylor\u2019s endless love songs that were written during the peak of her and Joe\u2019s relationship have struck a chord with her fans.\n\n\n## \nTaylor previously made it clear that she would struggle if the romance were to end, so there has understandably been concern for the star\u2019s well-being ever since news of the split broke.\n\n\n## \nBut on Saturday, Taylor appeared to offer her reassurance with a subtle gesture during her concert.\n\n\n## \nAs she performed her song \u201cDelicate,\u201d Taylor was spotted giving a quick thumbs-up to someone in the crowd who was holding up a sign that asked: \u201cYou OK?\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnd ultimately, that\u2019s all that really matters.\n\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

As of Tuesday, #snoopy has 813.9 million views on TikTok, and many creators have garnered followings for their Snoopy memes and peaceful, soothing fan montages. The Red Cross released an exclusive Snoopy shirt this month to attract more young blood donors, which has become an It girl item on TikTok. And the Snoopy stan community has experienced its own controversy, after a fan account posted a drawing that many lambasted as thinspo.\u00a0\n\nwhen baby Snoopy met Charlie Brown for the first time!!\n\nSnoopy Sister has become a beloved figure among many Snoopy fans, an example of young people with specific niche obsessions yet no interest in being publicly online. Her hiatus was announced by her sister on Twitter and TikTok.\n\n\u201cSnoopy sister is currently grounded from her phone and won\u2019t be able to make any edits for a while. She wants me to relay that to you all. She will get to make her edits again once she gets it together,\u201d Tram tweeted on March 31.\n\nSpeaking from her grounding, Snoopy Sister told BuzzFeed News that her disciplining was because she hasn\u2019t been doing well in her high school math classes. \u201cShe\u2019s been practicing doing math problems to bring her marks up because math is not her strong suit,\u201d Tram said.\u00a0\n\nThe sisters are based in Canada, but Tram asked to keep her sister\u2019s information and their surname anonymous, in order to protect their privacy. \u201cHonestly, sometimes [virality] feels a little fickle. Like ultimately we're just here to have a good time,\u201d Tram said. \u201cI\u2019m just respecting her decision to not be online so much, and cheer her on.\u201d\n\nSnoopy Sister said she first became interested in Snoopy when Tram took her to an amusement park. \u201cI didn't really enjoy the roller coasters, but she did mention a place called Snoopy Planet,\u201d she said. \u201cIn there, I saw a lot of Snoopies, and I wanted to know what character this was.\u201d\n\nShe began researching the show and creating edits on her phone, screen-recording clips she found online and splicing them together with music she liked, like R&B artists DPR Ian, PinkPantheress, and Luna Li. Since she doesn\u2019t have her own social accounts, she texted them to her sister, who thought they were funny and posted them on her platforms. \u201cShe's very soft-spoken and shy,\u201d Tram said. \u201cBut I was like, I feel like more people would appreciate this.\u201d\n\nSome family lore #fyp #snoopysister\n\nThe announcement of her hiatus, which now has 2.4 million views on TikTok, caused fans to flood the comments, crying out for her release. \u201cLET HER GO SHES NOT GUILTY \u270aI NEED MY SNOOPY EDITS TO SLEEP AT NIGHT,\u201d one commented. \u201ctell your parents the people say she\u2019s ungrounded,\u201d another said.\n\n\u201cworst news of the day,\u201d wrote the Malala Fund, a nonprofit founded by Malala Yousafzai that supports girls\u2019 education. \u201cNOT MALALA UPSET ABT MY SISTER BEING GROUNDED FROM HER PHONE,\u201d Tram tweeted after she saw it.\u00a0\n\nMany have asked Tram to tell their parents that Yousafzai appeared to be a Snoopy Sister fan, but the sisters said that their parents have no idea that any of this is going on \u2014 the edits, the fandom online, the millions of views.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think about telling my parents like, Malala doesn't want her to be grounded,\u201d Tram said. \u201cBut I wouldn't even know where to start.\u201d\n\nYousafzai\u2019s team told BuzzFeed News that the Nobel Prize\u2013winning activist doesn\u2019t manage the Malala Fund account that wrote the \u201cworst news\u201d comment. \u201cI'm not sure she's aware of the growth of Snoopy content on TikTok,\u201d one representative said.\n\n\"On TikTok, our digital team engages with and produces content by and for young women,\" a spokesperson for the Malala Fund told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday shortly after this story was published. \"But I can confirm Malala did not write that comment.\"\n\nBut Yousafzai has previously participated in online trends, like the \u201cbombastic side-eye\u201d TikTok audio posted on the Malala Fund account.\n\nTram is an artist and illustrator herself, and previously went viral on Twitter for a design of a koi fish drinking boba in 2021. She said she wants to encourage her younger sister\u2019s creative pursuits, and that a huge motivator for shielding her identity is to prevent the Snoopy edits from becoming a source of stress. \u201cI just tell her to keep it as a hobby,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's some people that have been reaching out for, like, \u2018Oh, we'll pay you to use this music.\u2019 But I don't want to put that sort of monetary pressure on my sister. I\u2019m just letting her go like a free-range chicken.\u201d\n\nThe grounding will end on April 19, according to Tram. Snoopy Sister said she\u2019s been practicing drawing Snoopy in her no-phone era and learning to code in HTML. She said she also loves raccoons and capybaras, and sees a lot of them on her For You page. \u201cI love Snoopy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I'll make an edit soon once I get my phone back.\u201d\n\n## More news\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

Andy Beshear said one of the people killed was one of his closest friends.\n\nLaw enforcement officers respond to a shooting near the Old National Bank building in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nA shooter opened fire at a bank Monday morning in Louisville, Kentucky, killing four people and injuring nine more.\n\nIn a press conference Monday afternoon, police identified the deceased victims as Joshua Barrick, 40, Thomas Elliott, 63, Juliana Farmer, 45, and James Tutt, 64. All four worked at Old National Bank, where the shooting took place. On Monday night, authorities announced that a fifth person, Deana Eckert, 57, had died.\n\nFighting back tears, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear told reporters that Elliott, the bank's vice president, had been one of his closest friends.\n\n\"Tommy Elliott helped me build my law career, helped me become governor, gave me advice on being a good dad,\" Beshear said. \"One of the people I talked to most in the world, and very rarely were we talking about my job. He was an incredible friend.\"\n\nAfter the shooting, the nine injured victims, five of whom suffered gunshot wounds, were transported to the University of Louisville Hospital, three of the injured were in critical condition and required surgery.

He used a rifle for the attack and livestreamed it on social media, Gwinn-Villaroel said.\n\n\"Let me say of this evil that took place today: We shouldn't hear the tears that were coming out from these families,\" she said. \"And that right there sticks, because they are weeping because someone decided that they wanted to take life today.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Meta told BuzzFeed News they \"are in touch with law enforcement and quickly removed the livestream.\"\n\nBank employee Troy Haste\u00a0told media\u00a0outside the bank he had been inside the first-floor conference room when the shooter began firing. \u201cHe just started shooting. He had a long assault rifle and you could hear shots just start firing,\u201d Haste\u00a0said. \u201cWe were in the conference room. Whoever was next to me got shot and blood\u2019s on me from it.\u201d\n\nPolice initially said five people had been killed, but later clarified that that number had included the suspect. In an earlier press conference, Beshear said two of his friends had been killed and another injured, but later said he'd received \"incorrect information,\" having learned the second friend he'd heard was killed was actually wounded but alive.\n\n\"I'd started to mourn, and now I know he's OK,\" Beshear said, adding that he'd visited him in the emergency room. \"While it's going to take him a while to heal, it was so good to see my friend, see him there with his wife, and know he is still with us.\"\n\nBeshear told reporters he knows \"virtually everyone\" who works in the building. \"My [attorney general] campaign was out of that building. ... That's my bank,\" he said, adding that he hopes everyone affected \"will reach out for help when they need it.\"\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn page, the suspect had worked at Old National since 2018, when he began as a summer associate intern. His most recent position at the company was that of syndications associate and portfolio banker.\u00a0\n\nHe had previously attended the University of Alabama as an undergraduate and postgraduate student, where he studied finance, and was a board member for the Junior Achievement of Kentuckiana, a youth development group.\u00a0\n\nThe suspect was born and raised in Indiana just over the river from Louisville. His father was a well-known local high school basketball coach, under whom he had played the sport while a student.\n\nFollowing the shooting, several of the suspect's social media accounts were deactivated. His father also locked his Twitter account.\u00a0\n\nMayor Craig Greenberg thanked the emergency responders and asked the public to \"pray with us\" for the injured victims \"fighting for their lives as a result of another act of gun violence.\"\n\n\"Our community will continue to come together,\" he said. \"We will find ways to love and support one another and the families and friends who have been directly impacted by these acts of gun violence, and we will come together as a community to work to prevent these horrific acts of gun violence from continuing here and around the state.\"\n\nGun violence in the US is a public health crisis, according to the\u00a0American Public Health Association. It is a leading cause of premature death in the country,\u00a0 responsible for more than 38,000 deaths\u00a0annually. As of April 10, at least 4,916 people have died from gun violence this year, and another 6,600 have died by suicide,\u00a0according to data from the Gun Violence Archive.

And then I went and touched myself.\u201d\n\n## \nBack in 2013, Aubrey Plaza starred in hit coming-of-age movie The To Do List.\n\n\n## \nAubrey portrayed Brandy Klark, a sexually inexperienced high school student who compiles a to-do list of sexual things to try out before going off to college.\n\n\n## \nAnd perhaps one of the movie\u2019s most memorably awkward scenes features Aubrey\u2019s character pleasuring herself \u2014 an experience that the actor previously described as super \u201cnerve-racking\u201d to film.\n\n\n## \nBut what\u2019s worse is that Aubrey actually had no idea what the scene would entail before it came to shooting.\n\n\n## \nDuring a recently resurfaced appearance on Conan from 2013, Aubrey claimed that the film\u2019s director, Maggie Carey, instructed her to touch herself in real life when they shot the scene with no prior warning.\n\n\n## \n\u201cIn my head, I envisioned a nice scene where you see my hand slowly go out of frame,\u201d Aubrey began, revealing that the script simply stated: \u201cBrandy masturbates.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cI thought I was doing one thing and then when I showed up, it was a whole different thing, it was a full-body shot,\u201d she recalled.\n\n\n## \n\u201cThe camera was mounted on the ceiling, I was in my underwear and a Clinton T-shirt, and there were a bunch of old men smoking \u2014 the crew guys,\u201d she detailed. \u201cAnd then I went and touched myself.\u201d\n\n\n## \nWhen Aubrey asked Maggie about the scene, the director was allegedly very blas\u00e9 about the entire thing.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI asked the director, \u2018What should I do?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Masturbate, like it says in the script,\u2019\u201d Aubrey claimed.\n\n\n## \nAt the time, Maggie called Aubrey \u201cbrave\u201d and \u201cgutsy\u201d for her performance.\n\n\n## \n\u201cShe was so brave,\u201d Maggie told Screen Slam. \u201cShe was game for everything, you know, which was so fun.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cAnd she had no problem putting herself in these very awkward situations. But, you know, it\u2019s played for comedy and she just nailed it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just so fun to work with her. She\u2019s very gutsy.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAfter Aubrey\u2019s past comments resurfaced online last week, several internet users were left seriously disturbed by her claim.\n\n\n## \n\u201cThis would never fly in 2022. An actor being like 'so what do I do' and the director is like 'go touch yourself on camera.' Without any kind of notice or warning that this is what they want to see?\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\n## \n\u201cwow, this is fucked up. The fact that she could openly talk about it and the director wouldn't get cancelled really is... that's fucked up,\u201d another said.\n\n\n## \nMeanwhile, other viewers went on to raise their eyebrows at the way Conan laughed the whole thing off.\n\n\n## \n\u201cThey all laugh it away, but this isn't ok. You can't order someone to pleasure herself for a tv show,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cIs this supposed to be funny...

Clay Jacke II sentenced Holder to 25 years to life in prison for the murder, along with 25 years under a firearm sentencing enhancement and 10 more for assault with a firearm, according to the Associated Press. Holder was also convicted of two counts of attempted voluntary manslaughter and two counts of assault with a firearm for wounding two bystanders.\u00a0\n\nHolder\u2019s attorney had argued that his conviction for Hussle\u2019s death should be reduced to voluntary manslaughter.\u00a0\n\nProsecutors, however, argued that the murder was premeditated, saying it was a result of long-building tensions. According to the AP, Holder and Hussle had known each other for years as members of the Rollin\u2019 60s gang, and both aspired to become rappers \u2014 though only Hussle found success.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Herman Douglas, a close friend of Hussle\u2019s who was standing with him when he was killed, told the judge of the impact the artist\u2019s death had on him personally and on the community, the LA Times reported.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOur community right now, we lost everything. Everything we worked for. \u2026 Thousands of jobs we don\u2019t have no more. Homies don\u2019t have nothing to do. They backsliding, they robbing people now,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cAll our stores are closed down. The whole community relied on Nip.\u201d\n\nNipsey Hussle\n\nHolder\u2019s defense attorney also presented the court with a letter from his father, apologizing for his actions and describing his diagnosis of schizophrenia, the AP reported.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know there are not enough words that would fill the void, the pain, the deep sorrow that they feel,\u201d the letter read. \u201cI question myself every day asking if I as a father did everything to help Eric Jr. stabilize his mental health.\u201d\n\nThe judge said he had considered Holder\u2019s mental health in the sentence.\n\n\u201cI am very mindful of what was presented as to Mr. Holder\u2019s mental health,\u201d Jacke said, according to the AP. \u201cI am also mindful of the devastation caused to the victims and their families. I believe this sentence balances the two.\u201d\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Olivia Culpo Has Endometriosis. These Are The Products She Swears By.\n\nOne in 10 women have endometriosis, so why is it still so difficult to diagnose and treat? Olivia Culpo weighed in on what worked for her.\n\nHealth & Fitness Commerce Writer\n\nOlivia Culpo has never really had a normal period.\u00a0And yes, she talks openly about periods and everything that goes along with them, because people sharing their experiences was her key to finally getting diagnosed with endometriosis.\n\nThrough her frustrating journey to figure out what was causing her extremely painful periods, the model, social media influencer, and former Miss Rhode Island eventually became an expert on endometriosis, a condition in which tissue similar to the uterine lining, or endometrium, grows outside of the uterus.\u00a0\n\nIt can take an average of eight to 10 years to receive a proper diagnosis, she said. And it may look different in every body, because the tissue can grow anywhere \u2014 your liver, ovaries, rectum, appendix, colon, and more. The result is debilitating pain and sometimes infertility.\n\nDozens of doctors told Culpo she was fine, suggesting over-the-counter pain relievers like Advil, or questioning how bad her pain really was, regardless of the fact that she was in absolute agony. The pain only got worse over time \u2014 at first happening only during her period, then in between cycles, and eventually constantly. Finding ways to manage her pain and still live her life while she fought for answers was not easy.\n\n\u201cI lived in the bath. I would do all of my work in the bath,\u201d she said. Her pain was mostly in her lower back, and applying heat was one of the few things that helped.\n\nAdding some Epsom salts (a source of magnesium) to baths can make them even more effective when it comes to easing swelling, stiffness, and pain, and even reducing stress.\n\nYou can buy Dr Teal\u2019s Pure Epsom Salt from Amazon for around $23.\n\nYou can buy Ancient Minerals Magnesium Bath Flakes from Enviromedica for around $11.\n\nWhen she couldn\u2019t be in the bath, she applied targeted heat to her lower back. Hot water bottles worked better for her than electric heating pads, particularly this super soft one from Naked Cashmere that she traveled everywhere with.\u00a0\n\nYou can buy the Love Cashmere Hot Water Bottle from Naked Cashmere for around $125.\n\nAside from heat, lower back massages could also temporarily ease her pain, as did these Highline Wellness CBD Gummies.\n\nYou can buy Anytime CBD Gummies from Highline Wellness for around $42. (There is limited scientific evidence for the effectiveness of CBD for pain relief. We suggest consulting your doctor and following dosage guidelines.)\n\nBananas were helpful for the cramping, as was generally managing her diet to limit sugar and caffeine (although she did rely on chocolate for a dopamine release). Midol, a menstrual period classic, was another saving grace.\u00a0\n\nYou can buy Midol from Amazon for around $7.\n\nDespite the years of debilitating pain, Culpo said she never would have gotten the help she needed if she had not found a support system.\n\n\u201cIt was from looking online, just like sobbing in the bath, looking on Reddit and YouTube and following other people\u2019s journeys that I was finally like, \u2018Oh, these are my symptoms. This is what this person had. This is what they did,\u2019\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\nShe found a strong endometriosis community called Endo Warriors. \u201cEverybody really supports one another on a ton of different forums, from Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok. I would encourage anybody out there to use those resources, not only to get answers, but also to feel like they\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nThis online community is what made her realize that although her doctors were doing their best, they didn\u2019t know everything, and specifically didn\u2019t know enough about endometriosis. Armed with new information and confidence about what was causing her pain, she finally found a specialist who would treat her.\n\n\u201cNo doctor told me that I [had endometriosis]. I had to go in there and be like, This is what I have, I know that this is what I have, please help me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was that doctor that found the endometrioma, and then it was another doctor who also specialized in endometriosis who did my surgery.\u201d\n\nEndometriomas are cysts that can be seen on an ultrasound. If those can\u2019t be visualized during a scan, surgery followed by a biopsy of the abnormal tissue is needed for a solid diagnosis. Not all doctors are able to or want to do this surgery, which is one reason why it can take so long to be diagnosed. The ones who do specialize know exactly what it is when they see it and are often able to scrape out the endometrioma during surgery; this is what happened for Culpo.\n\nHer life changed after the surgery. Culpo had the Mirena IUD inserted, essentially halting her menstrual bleeding to suppress future flare-ups; her symptoms evaporated.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary when you feel like you're in so much pain and nothing helps, and it's even scarier when you feel like nobody believes you or has the answer,\u201d she said. It took years of advocating for herself to find the answer and the solution, but she hopes her story can help others avoid that prolonged, painful experience. So she\u2019s not going to stop talking about periods, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\u00a0\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# TikTok\u2019s CEO Got Blasted By Both Sides During An Intense Congressional Hearing\n\nShou Zi Chew was forced to defend the Chinese-owned app, which some US lawmakers want to ban.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew prepares to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Capitol Hill on March 23, 2023, in Washington, DC.\u00a0\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew faced a bipartisan grilling on Thursday as he appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee to address lawmakers\u2019 concerns about the video sharing app, which has 150 million active users in the US. Of particular concern to the committee was the company\u2019s China-based parent company, ByteDance, and its suspected ties to the Chinese government.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values, values for freedom, human rights, and innovation,\" committee chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican from Washington, said in her opening statement. \u201cTikTok has repeatedly chosen the path for more control, more surveillance, and more manipulation. Your platform should be banned.\"There are currently three bills in Congress that could affect American access to TikTok; two would legislate an outright ban of the platform, while the other would give the government the power to ban any technologies that are deemed a national security risk. The Biden administration reportedly has demanded that ByteDance sell TikTok, threatening a total ban on the app if the China-based company fails to comply. On Thursday, a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said that the government would oppose a forced sale.\n\nDuring the five-hour hearing, the Singapore-born Chew, 40, emphasized that there has never been any evidence of the Chinese government accessing TikTok user data. He said that countries that have banned the app on government devices have done so based on \u201chypothetical and theoretical risks.\u201d Last month, both the US and Canada issued orders banning the use of TikTok on government-issued mobile devices.\n\n\u201cLet me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,\u201d Chew declared in his written statement.\u00a0\n\nHowever, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed doubts about this claim, and many committee members jokingly thanked the TikTok CEO for inspiring bipartisanship. \u201cYou have unified Republicans and Democrats and, if only for a day, we\u2019re actually unified because we have serious concerns,\u201d said Rep. August Pfluger, a Republican from Texas.\u00a0\n\nChew\u2019s go-to answer when questioned about data privacy was Project Texas, the platform\u2019s ongoing operation to move information about its American users to US-based servers. The TikTok CEO said that no China-based employees would have access to American user data once the project was completed, but committee members questioned whether this internal firewall would eliminate their security concerns.\u00a0\n\n\"What you\u2019re saying about Project Texas just doesn\u2019t pass the smell test,\" said Rep. Angie Craig, a Democrat from Minnesota. \"My constituents are concerned that TikTok and the Chinese Communist Party are controlling their data and seeing our own vulnerabilities. \u2026 What you\u2019re doing down in Texas is all well and good, but it is not enough to be convinced that our privacy is not at risk.\"\u00a0\n\nAs BuzzFeed News exclusively reported last year, China-based ByteDance employees accessed nonpublic US TikTok user data on several occasions between September 2021 and January 2022. In December, ByteDance said in a statement that an internal investigation revealed that personal TikTok user data of the BuzzFeed News reporter who broke the story \u2014\u00a0and several other journalists who cover TikTok \u2014 had been accessed without authorization by ByteDance employees who were then fired.\n\nWhen asked by Rep. Neal Dunn, a Republican from Florida, during the hearing if ByteDance had ever spied on American citizens, Chew responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think that \u2018spying\u2019 is the right way to describe it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n.@DrNealDunnFL2: \"Has ByteDance spied on American citizens?\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew: \"I don't think that spying is the right way to describe it.\"\n\nAs the TikTok CEO noted throughout the hearing, many of the issues raised by lawmakers were not unique to TikTok as a platform but rather ongoing problems all social media companies are trying to combat (such as moderation complications and the platform\u2019s impact on mental health, particularly of young people).\n\nShortly before the end of the hearing, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, voiced his support for legislation banning TikTok. \u201cI think you see a bipartisan concern here with what's happening on TikTok, especially what's happening to the data for Americans,\u201d he told CNN.\u00a0\n\nIn a joint statement issued following the hearing, seantors Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, and John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, expressed their continued concerns about the platform. (The two lawmakers are the sponsors of the RESTRICT Act, one of the bills addressing TikTok national security concerns.) \u201cUnder [People's Republic of China] law, all Chinese companies, including TikTok, whose parent company is based in Beijing, are ultimately required to do the bidding of Chinese intelligence services, should they be called upon to do so,\u201d they said.\u201cNothing we heard from Mr. Chew today assuaged those concerns,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cIt is vital for Congress to establish a process to review and mitigate the harms posed by foreign technology products that come from places like China and Russia. We are encouraged by the quick momentum and strong bipartisan support for our legislation and expect that it will only grow following today\u2019s testimony.\u201d\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Wyoming Has Become The First State To Ban The Abortion Pill\n\nThe new ban, which prohibits any prescription, distribution, or use of medication abortion, carries a penalty of up to six months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of up to $9,000.\n\nAbortion rights adovcates gather in front of the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, on March 15, 2023.\n\nWyoming has banned the abortion pill, becoming the first state to specifically outlaw using medication for abortion in the \u201cProhibiting chemical abortions\u201d bill that became state law on Friday.\n\nGov. Mark Gordon signed the bill the same day he said he would not veto another statewide abortion ban, a near-total prohibition that makes providing abortion a felony and goes into effect this Sunday. The medication abortion ban will go into effect July 1.\n\nAccording to the new law, it is illegal to \u201cto prescribe, dispense, distribute, sell or use any drug for the purpose of procuring or performing an abortion,\u201d and anyone found to be violating the rule can be imprisoned for up to six months, fined $9,000, or both.\n\nPlan B One-Step and other morning-after pills that are taken before pregnancy is confirmed are exempted from the ban, and exceptions are also stated for cases of sexual assault, incest, \u201cnatural miscarriage,\u201d and procedures for \u201cimminent peril that substantially endangers [a pregnant person's] life or health,\u201d not including mental health conditions. The law also exempts the pregnant person from prosecution for their own abortion.\n\nGordon said he believed the new laws will likely be challenged in court and urged a state referendum on abortion, per the Washington Post. \u201cI believe this question needs to be decided as soon as possible so that the issue of abortion in Wyoming can be finally resolved, and that is best done with a vote of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nFifteen states have some restriction on medication abortion, according to reproductive rights think tank the Guttmacher Institute, in addition to the 12 states where it is already de facto banned under general bans on abortion. However, Wyoming is the first state to prohibit medication abortion specifically and separately from other general bans.\n\nCurrently, the Women\u2019s Health & Family Care Clinic in Jackson, Wyoming, is the only abortion clinic in the state, according to the New York Times. The clinic only provides the pill, not surgical procedures.\n\nAbortion rights protesters chant slogans during a gathering to protest the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health case on June 24, 2022, in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nThe law comes as several states have pushed forward anti-abortion measures following the Supreme Court's overturn of Roe v. Wade. On Wednesday, a Texas judge heard arguments in a case brought by an anti-abortion group that is seeking to have mifepristone, one of two drugs commonly used in abortion medication, removed from the market by the Food and Drug Administration. Many are waiting for the ruling, which could make mifepristone unavailable even in states where abortion is legal.\n\nNationally, medication abortion is estimated to account for more than half of abortions in the United States.\n\nIn a public statement, the ACLU of Wyoming\u2019s advocacy director Antonio Serrano condemned the bans. \u201cA person\u2019s health, not politics, should guide important medical decisions \u2013 including the decision to have an abortion,\u201d Serrano said. \u201cThe fight for abortion rights in Wyoming isn\u2019t over. We will continue to challenge efforts contrary to our right to make our own reproductive health care decisions.\u201d\n\nWyoming was the first state to grant women the right to vote in 1869. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, the state\u2019s abortion ban trigger law, which went into effect with the fall of Roe, became a legal battleground as lawmakers debated its constitutionality, causing a judge to grant a preliminary injunction to suspend the trigger law while the legal battles played out.\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

So, I started doing that.\u201d\n\n## \nBy now, you\u2019re likely aware of the lengths Austin Butler went to when preparing for the role of Elvis Presley.\n\n\n## \nBut if you somehow managed to miss it, allow me to quickly fill you in.\n\n\n## \nAustin was cast as the late icon in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 2022 biopic, and his severe commitment to the role had a lasting impact.\n\n\n## \nNot only did Austin avoid seeing his family for three years while he was preparing for and shooting the project, but he was also left unaware of his own identity by the time filming wrapped.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI didn't see my family for about three years. I was off in New York prepping with Baz, and then I went to Australia. I had months where I wouldn\u2019t talk to anybody. When I did, the only thing I was ever thinking about was Elvis,\u201d he said last December.\n\n\n## \nIn fact, up until a couple of weeks ago, Austin had continued to speak in Elvis\u2019s notable Southern accent, claiming that he believed it had become a part of his \u201cDNA.\u201d\n\n\n## \nFans ended up labeling Austin \u201cinsufferable\u201d for taking method acting way too seriously, while he also admitted that he fell into \u201ca rabbit hole of obsession\u201d with his dedication to the role.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI broke down his life into periods of time where I could hear the differences in how his voice changed over the years and how his movement changed over the years, and I spent two years studying, trying to find his humanity as best as I could through that,\u201d Austin said at the Cannes Film Festival last May.\n\n\n## \nNow, Austin is opening up further about the measures he took to become Elvis Presley, revealing that he also underwent a physical transformation.\n\n\n## \nExplaining that he needed to gain weight in order to play the older version of Elvis in parts of the film, Austin revealed on Variety\u2019s Awards Circuit podcast this week that while he wore a bodysuit for some scenes, he wanted to ensure that he was as prepared as possible in real life, too.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI would go get two dozen doughnuts and eat them all,\u201d Austin said. \u201cI really started to pack on some pounds.\u201d\n\n\n## \nExplaining that he ended up feeling \u201cawful\u201d with himself after incorporating these new eating habits, Austin continued, \u201cIt's fun for a week or so, and then you feel awful with yourself.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnd going on to reveal that he also took inspiration from fellow actor Ryan Gosling, Austin shared more details about how he achieved his physical transformation for Elvis.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI heard that Ryan Gosling, when he was going to do The Lovely Bones, had microwaved H\u00e4agen-Dazs and would drink it. So I started doing that,\u201d he said.\n\n\n## \nIf you didn\u2019t know, Ryan memorably gained weight for the 2009 Peter Jackson film after being cast as the character of Jack Salmon.\n\n\n## \nRyan revealed that he drank melted H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream in order to achieve his goal, which he set in place due to how he envisioned the character.\n\n\n## \nHowever, the film\u2019s director and producers did not approve of Ryan\u2019s weight gain and ultimately fired him from the movie just days before production began in 2007.\n\n\n## \n\u201cWe had a different idea of how the character should look,\u201d Ryan told the Hollywood Reporter after being replaced by Mark Wahlberg.\n\n\n## \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t talk very much during the pre-production process, which was the problem,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was a huge movie, and there\u2019s so many things to deal with, and he couldn\u2019t deal with the actors individually. I just showed up on set, and I had gotten it wrong.\u201d\n\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# The Deaths Of 100 Infants Have Now Been Linked To The Fisher Price Rock 'N Play Sleeper\n\nEight of the deaths happened after the initial recall.\n\nAbout 100 infants have died while using Fisher-Price's Rock 'n Play Sleepers, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday as it once again urged parents not to use the once-popular piece of baby gear.\n\nThe sleeper was first recalled in April 2019, and at that time 30 deaths were linked to it. Infants were able to roll from their back to their stomach or side when unrestrained or under other circumstances, causing them to suffocate. The original recall included 4.7 million sleepers, and consumers were urged to stop using them immediately and seek a refund from Fisher-Price.\n\nOn Monday, the commission revealed that 70 more deaths have been linked to the sleeper, which was sold at major retailers like Walmart, Target, and Amazon from September 2009 until the 2019 recall. Eight of those deaths took place after the initial recall announcement.\n\nMattel, Fisher-Price's parent company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a 2019 news release, Kyle Yasuda, then-president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that pediatricians have recommended against inclined sleepers for many years because they \"contradict AAP's own evidence-based safe sleep recommendations.\" Doctors recommend that babies be put down to sleep on their backs on a flat surface, without any blankets, pillows, or soft toys.\n\nBut for years, Fisher-Price marketed the Rock 'n Play as a safe place for infants to sleep, suggesting it could even ease fussiness. It became hugely popular.\n\n\u201cHaving these dangerous and unnecessary products on store shelves confuses parents and contributes to sleep-related infant deaths,\" Yasuda said in 2019.\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission also announced a renewed recall of Kids2 Rocking Sleepers on Tuesday for the same reason as the Rock 'n Play \u2014 15 infants died while using the product and rolling from their backs to their stomachs. Eleven infants died before the initial recall in April 2019, and four have died since.\n\nIn 2021, Boppy recalled its newborn lounger after eight infants died of suffocation while using it, and in late 2022, MamaRoo baby swings were recalled after one baby died and another sustained injuries to their neck.\n\n## More on this\n\n",

        "article": "# Bird Flu Has Taken Out Millions Of Chickens And Turkeys. What That Means For Humans.\n\nThe risk to humans is still low, but cases in mammals are growing globally, which is a troubling step on the road toward human infection.\n\nMore than 58 million domestic fowl in the US have died or been culled over the past 12 months due to a large outbreak of the avian flu \u2014 the deadliest outbreak in the country\u2019s history, according to the Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe specter of an avian flu pandemic is always on health authorities\u2019 minds. Should we be worried this time? According to the CDC, the risk to humans right now is low.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not considering this anything that needs to be on people\u2019s minds continuously,\u201d said Geoffrey Lossie, an avian diagnostician at Purdue University's College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nHowever, this avian virus \u2014 the H5N1 strain of influenza \u2014 has a mortality rate in humans of 50%, which is one reason scientists are keeping a close watch on it.\u00a0\n\nSo many chickens have been killed it\u2019s contributing to an egg shortage in the US that\u2019s driving up prices. Egg prices more than doubled in 2022 but have since declined, and other factors, like inflation and demand, have played a role in the cost of eggs.\n\nThe H5N1 virus has been detected in more than 120 wild mammals in the US in 2022 and 2023, including red foxes, skunks, and even grizzly bears \u2014 a troubling step in the road toward human infection.\n\nAn outbreak at a mink farm in Spain suggested the virus can now spread in mammals, and 52,000 infected animals had to be culled. This week, four dead seals tested positive for bird flu in Scotland, as did 585 sea lions in Peru, suggesting cases are growing globally in mammals.\n\nPast avian flus have moved from birds to other animals, but the number of mammals that have been infected recently is unusual, said Gregory C. Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \u201cThere\u2019s concern that it could further change and jump to humans,\u201d he said.\n\nThe H5N1 strain of influenza is a mix of DNA from a Eurasian lineage of the virus and a North American lineage, Lossie said. The strain has had a 53% death rate among humans, based on 858 reported cases globally since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. The \u201cH\u201d and \u201cN\u201d refer to proteins on the surface of the influenza virus that affect how the virus behaves.\u00a0\n\n## What is bird flu?\n\nDifferent influenza viruses tend to target different species, said Dr. William Schaffner, a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\u00a0\n\nAvian flu is carried by wild migratory birds like wild ducks and geese and usually follows certain patterns. The virus typically doesn\u2019t sicken or kill wild birds, though it does kill domestic fowl. In this case, though, influenza is making some wild birds sick, Lossie said.\n\nUsually the virus passes from wild birds to domestic birds through feces. In the current outbreak, there is some evidence that the avian flu is also passing through respiratory droplets in wild birds. It\u2019s definitely being shed through the respiratory route in domestic birds like chickens and turkeys, Lossie said.\n\nAnd while the number of birds who have perished from the avian flu is about the same as in a 2015 avian flu outbreak, the outbreak has now visited double the number of states.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis does suggest that bird flu is more widely distributed geographically,\u201d Schaffner said.\n\nAlso, Lossie added that scientists have detected far more infections in wild birds during this outbreak than in past outbreaks.\n\n## How does bird flu get to humans?\n\nIt\u2019s rare for the exact same virus that infects birds to reach humans. \u201cThe appropriate receptors in the mucous membranes in our throats, noses, and upper part of our respiratory tract are not very receptive to bird flu,\u201d Schaffner said.\n\nWhen it does happen, it\u2019s usually in someone who lives and works closely with birds \u2014 and the infection stops there. Since the outbreak began, there have only been four cases in humans and one death.\u00a0\n\n\u201cQuite a number of different strains of avian flu have spilled over to humans, but they\u2019ve had limited, if any, human-to-human transmission,\u201d Gray said. \u201cOften it\u2019s a dead end.\u201d Only one person in the US, a poultry worker in Colorado, was infected by the current strain in April while culling poultry infected with H5N1. He reported only fatigue and was treated with antivirals. He has since recovered, Lossie said. (There was also a second human case in South West England detected at the end of 2021.)\n\nUsually there\u2019s another step involved: The virus has to mutate enough to infect a mammal and mutate again to infect people. Every time a virus replicates, DNA can mutate, giving it opportunities to infect different life forms. New strains of a virus also happen through genetic drift, which is when two virus strains \u2014 say one human and one avian \u2014 combine to create a new variant, Lossie said.\n\n\u201cMost pandemics generate when there is a species jump and usually with an intermediate host where the virus can evolve,\u201d said Dr. Cesar Arias, chief of infectious diseases at Houston Methodist Hospital. \u201cThe concern here is the Spanish report of mink transmission. There could be a genetic adaptation in which the virus can become airborne from human to human.\u201d\n\nSo far, the CDC said that the circulating virus lacks the genetic changes that would allow it to easily cause illness in humans.\n\n## How deadly is bird flu in humans?\n\nIt can be very deadly, with a mortality rate as high as 50% in the cases where bird flu has jumped directly from birds to farmers and other handlers, Schaffner said.\n\nEvery time the virus replicates, it can mutate into a version the human immune system has never seen before. \u201cThat makes it harder for our immune systems to fight the infection,\u201d Arias said. \u201cWhen they get to humans, the adaptations tend to be accompanied by high virulence, which means infections are severe with high mortality.\u201d\n\nBasically, our bodies have never encountered these new viruses and have no defenses. This is effectively what happened with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.\n\n## How worried should we be?\n\nRight now, the avian flu doesn\u2019t warrant five-alarm concern, experts said.\n\nBut things could change. While it takes time for a pandemic to develop, \u201cI think we\u2019re headed in that direction,\u201d Arias said.\n\nRight now, the biggest risk is to humans who have a lot of contact with birds, especially poultry, Lossie said. That includes not only people in commercial poultry operations but also people with backyard flocks, which are on the rise due to the rising price of eggs in stores.\n\n## Are there ways to protect ourselves?\n\nThe current outbreak remains a matter mainly for public health organizations for the foreseeable future. The USDA has a surveillance system in place to track avian flu in birds \u2014 one they say is the strongest in the world.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe need to be sure the US government is very vigilant through surveillance and be alert for novel viruses that might spill into humans,\u201d Gray said.\n\nThere aren\u2019t any avian flu vaccines widely available, but there are prototypes. \u201cThe vaccines have basically been constructed then the question would be how quickly to manufacture them,\u201d Schaffner said.\n\nThe CDC cautions against unprotected contact with wild or domestic birds. They recommend wearing an N95 respiratory or surgical mask, eye protection, disposable gloves, and boots as well as washing your hands after any contact and don\u2019t touch your mouth, nose, or eyes, all possible points of entry for the virus.\n\nIf you have chickens or other birds (including pet birds), keep them protected from wild birds. \u201cTry to shelter your backyard herd or flocks of chickens from migratory birds,\u201d Schaffner said.\n\nAvian flu in wild and domestic birds isn\u2019t in and of itself a cause for panic, Schaffner added. \u201cThere\u2019s no immediate threat but public health authorities are on the alert.\u201d \u25cf\n\n## More on this\n\n",

Gloria Johnson are recognized by the audience at Fisk University before Vice President Kamala Harris arrives in Nashville on April 7, 2023.\n\nOne of the two Tennessee lawmakers who were expelled from the Legislature for protesting for gun control\u00a0in the wake of a\u00a0deadly Nashville school shooting was reinstated to his seat Monday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County voted unanimously to send Justin Jones of Nashville back to the Statehouse on an interim basis. Justin Pearson, the other expelled lawmaker, from Memphis, could also be reappointed later this week.\n\n\"On Thursday, April the 6th, we witnessed a miscarriage of justice and an egregious assault on our democracy which resulted in over 70,000 Davidson County voters being silenced,\" Council Member Delishia Porterfield said after formally nominating Jones to his seat. \"Their will should have never been undermined.\"\n\nThe council's vote sends a strong message to the state legislature and the rest of the country \"that we will not tolerate threats to our democracy,\" Porterfield added.\n\nMinutes after the vote, Jones led hundreds of demonstrators in a march to the state capitol.\n\nJustin Jones leading a march of about 1,000 people through downtown Nashville as he returns to the state legislature #TennesseeThree\n\nHe was then sworn in on the capitol steps before returning to the chamber.\n\nJones and Pearson, both young Black men who were in their first terms, have said they plan to run in the coming special elections for their seats. If reelected, they could not be expelled for the same offense.\n\nThe two lawmakers\u00a0were voted out by the House's Republican supermajority on Thursday for protesting against gun violence in the state capitol after six people, including three children, were killed in a shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville on March 27. Democratic Rep. Gloria Johnson, another member who participated in the protest, survived by a single vote.\n\nJones raises his fist on the floor of the Tennessee House chamber after being expelled from the Legislature on April 6, 2023.\n\nTheir removal was widely criticized by leaders across the country, including President Joe Biden, who tweeted, \"The expulsion of lawmakers who engaged in peaceful protest is shocking, undemocratic, and unprecedented.\"\u00a0 Expulsions have previously been used to remove members accused of serious offenses, like soliciting a bribe or\u00a0allegedly committing sexual misconduct.\n\nThough House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who leads the GOP's supermajority, tried to compare the lawmakers' actions to those of the Jan. 6 rioters at the US Capitol, no protesters broke into the building, damaged any property, or were arrested. Also unlike the 2021 insurrection in Washington, DC, the demonstrators were allowed in the building after going through security screening, the\u00a0Tennessean\u00a0reported.\n\nPrior to Jones's reappointment, Doug Kufner, a spokesperson for Sexton, said in a statement provided to BuzzFeed News that whoever is appointed to the vacancies by the Nashville and Shelby County governments \"will be seated as representatives as the constitution requires.\"\n\n## More on this\n\n",

But After 15 Votes, The California Republican Finally Won The Gavel\n\nThe inability of Republicans to coalesce around a candidate for House speaker was the longest bid in 164 years \u2014 and the butt of jokes on social media.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy listens during the 12th round of voting in the House chamber to elect a speaker in Washington on Jan. 6, 2023.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy was finally elected speaker of the House of Representatives in the wee hours of Saturday morning after failing to win a majority in 14 rounds of voting.\n\nFor four long, exhausting days, the Republican party struggled to coalesce around a candidate to lead the House after winning a narrow majority in the chamber in the Nov. 8 election. It was the longest bid for speaker in 164 years \u2014 and the butt of jokes on social media.\n\nI am now calling on @ABC to offer Kevin McCarthy his Dancing With The Stars contract NOW, so he can leave this fight with dignity.\n\nIn the final and 15th ballot, McCarthy won 216 votes, while House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries received 212 votes from his fellow Democrats. Six Republicans voted present, lowering the threshold McCarthy needed to win a majority.\n\nThe stalemate kept the representatives from being formally sworn in and prevented the House from getting started on any legislative work.\n\nThough McCarthy started out Friday with two more losses in the 12th and 13th vote tallies, the California Republican made significant progress and flipped more than a dozen holdouts in his favor. The House then voted to adjourn until 10 p.m. ET before returning to vote yet again.\n\nMcCarthy and his allies appeared confident that they finally had the votes going into the 14th count, but they ultimately fell short by one vote in a stunning defeat. The late-night drama sparked an ugly confrontation on the House floor with Rep. Mike Rogers having to be physically restrained while getting into a verbal altercation with Rep. Matt Gaetz, whose decision to vote present instead of for McCarthy cost the would-be speaker a victory on the 14th ballot.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson, left, pulls Rep.

        "article": "# This Tennessee Drag Queen Has A Message For The Governor: \u201cWe Will Not Go Quietly\u201d\n\n\u201c[The bill] gives everyone who\u2019s enforcing it across the state a license to bully not only drag performers but potentially trans people who are doing any sort of performance.\"\n\nSlade Kyle\n\nIn a matter of days, Slade Kyle\u2019s livelihood could land them in jail.\u00a0\n\nThe Memphis-based drag queen was visiting their family on Thursday in West Tennessee when they first heard that the state\u2019s ban on drag performances had passed the House.\n\nThe bill, HB 9, classifies \u201cmale and female impersonators\u201d as adult cabaret performers and bans them from public property or anywhere a minor might be able to see them, invoking the state\u2019s obscenity law.\n\nHB 9, which is now headed to Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s desk, would also be the country\u2019s first legal ban on drag. In 15 states across the country, there are more than 20 bills that target drag performances. At the same time, the governor could make Tennessee the third state to ban trans healthcare for minors this year, after Utah and South Dakota. A similar bill in Mississippi is also a governor\u2019s signature away from becoming law.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was not surprised,\u201d Kyle told BuzzFeed News. \u201cBut it is still disheartening to sit there out in the middle of the woods on a rainy back porch trying hard to enjoy the beauty of nature and wondering why these people are sitting in a room debating my humanity and trying to strip my rights away.\u201d\n\nThe Republican governor now has a little over a week to sign the bill \u2014 but even if he vetoes it, the Legislature can override his actions and enact the bill into law as soon as April 1. A first violation of the law would be a misdemeanor, and subsequent violations would be classified as a felony charge, punishable by up to six years in prison and a $3,000 fine.\u00a0\n\nWhen Kyle, 42, who performs as Bella DuBalle (a play on the 17th-century idiom \u201cbelle of the ball\u201d), started drag a decade ago, they could not have imagined such a law could prohibit \u2014 and potentially criminalize \u2014 their artistic career.\u00a0\n\nLast weekend, a patron at a drag brunch recorded Kyle, in drag as DuBalle, as they urged people to stand up against this legislation, drawing parallels to the 1969 Stonewall rebellion.\n\nAmazing defiant speech from Bella Duball in Tennessee against the anti drag bill there.\n\n\u201cIf they try to take drag away, this year we will remind them we will fight for our liberation. We will raise our bricks high.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe original Pride was a riot and this year we need to remind them that we will fight for our liberation,\u201d Kyle says in the video, which has garnered millions of views across TikTok and Twitter. \u201cWe will raise our bricks up high again and let them know that we will not go quietly.\u201d\n\nAs a child growing up in rural western Tennessee, Kyle said drag helped them come to terms with their nonbinary identity.\n\n\u201cAs trite as it is to say, drag saved my life. Drag completely changed me, and I can't imagine having to give it up,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cI take deep personal offense to people telling me that it\u2019s ugly or sexual or wrong when I know that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nRepublican state Rep. Chris Todd, who filed the legislation, however, has insisted that drag is inherently inappropriate and that the law would protect minors from obscenity. Todd first pushed for this bill after he took issue with a drag show at a public Pride event in Jackson, a two-hour drive from Memphis, in October last year.\u00a0\n\nThe public event at Jackson Pride was initially billed as a \u201cfamily-friendly drag show,\u201d but after weeks of heated debate between city officials and members of the Pride committee, the event was moved indoors and restricted to patrons over the age of 18.\u00a0\n\nTodd, at the time, filed a request for an injunction to block the event from happening at all, calling the drag show a form of \u201cchild abuse,\u201d the Tennessean reported.\u00a0\n\nKyle, who performed at the Jackson event, said Todd\u2019s actions were \u201creally harsh,\u201d and they worry about how this law could be enforced. They worry not only for their own safety and future drag career but also for the other performers and the Atomic Rose nightclub, where they are the show host and director.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of fear among my performers,\u201d Kyle said. The others are worried about their ability to pay rent or feed their children, and the difficulty of finding other employment opportunities as trans or gender-nonconforming people, they added.\n\nAs Kyle and others across the state await the governor\u2019s signature, advocates say the biggest unknown is how the law will be enforced. Tennessee already has laws on the books that regulate\u00a0where adult cabaret can take place, but this legislation expands the definition of adult cabaret beyond a specific place to mean any kind of male and female \u201cimpersonation\u201d performance.\u00a0\n\nKathy Sinback, the executive director of the ACLU in Tennessee, said that because the bill\u2019s language around what constitutes performance is \u201cnot well defined,\u201d it could lead to broader attacks on trans people across the state.\u00a0\n\n\u201c[The bill] gives everyone who\u2019s enforcing it across the state a license to bully not only drag performers but potentially trans people who are doing any sort of performance. \u2026 It can be interpreted as broadly as the narrow-minded people in the state want to interpret it,\u201d Sinback said.\n\nShe also worries the bill will create a lot of confusion around what is and isn\u2019t legal \u2014 and could lead to people being harassed for expressing themselves in a way that\u2019s protected by the US Constitution.\u00a0\n\nSinback said it has been \u201cterrifying\u201d to see how the introduction of this bill has already emboldened anti-trans legislators and protesters to target drag events across the state. Last month in Giles County, local lawmakers tried to stop a drag performance from happening in a public park. A week later in Cookeville, a group carrying swastikas and hurling accusations of child abuse protested a drag brunch.\u00a0\n\nSinback said that the ACLU plans to sue the state if the bill becomes law. The civil rights organization also plans to immediately challenge Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for trans youth through an injunction, if Lee signs it.\n\nLee is expected to sign both pieces of legislation, though his office did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News\u2019 request for comment.\u00a0\n\nKyle, however, plans to keep performing as usual at the club on Beale Street in Memphis; they said they plan to march today alongside dozens of other drag performers in the city and have organized with others about how they will take care of one another when the bill becomes law.\u00a0\n\nOn April 1, the day the ban is set to go into effect, the Atomic Rose will host its Brick Ball, a drag show to commemorate the 54th anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion. Kyle said they are inspired by trans advocates like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two trans women who are largely credited for throwing the first brick as police raided the New York gay bar in the 1970s.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that we will fight for our freedom, if necessary. It\u2019s not a threat. It\u2019s a promise,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cAnd I am terrified to have to hold that promise \u2026 but we have to fight even if we\u2019re terrified. Nobody wants to have to be the next Marsha P. Johnson.\u201d\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Vloggers Hank And John Green Want You To Take College Courses On YouTube\n\nThe brothers announced their new educational initiative, Study Hall, a partnership with Arizona State University and YouTube.\n\nHank Green and his brother, John, the bestselling author of The Fault in Our Stars and other young adult novels, have posted endless hours of educational content on their Vlogbrothers YouTube channel, which has more than 3.5 million subscribers. Now they\u2019re expanding their mission: Yesterday, the Green brothers announced a new initiative, Study Hall, which allows users to gain college credit, for a very reasonable rate, by taking classes on YouTube.Study Hall is a partnership between Crash Course, a YouTube-based educational channel produced by Complexly, a company set up by the Greens; Arizona State University; and YouTube. The video program guides users through key questions, like whether college is even right for them, and if it is, helps them learn what they can major in and how they can enter the work world afterward.\n\nMore significantly, Study Hall allows users to take courses online in order to earn college credits accredited through ASU. That means those credits can be counted toward a degree at ASU, or hundreds of other colleges that recognize programs developed by ASU.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d looked a lot at what we do at Crash Course and felt really good about that,\u201d Hank Green told BuzzFeed News. \u201cWe had intentionally said, 'We make content, and that\u2019s what we do.' But the idea presents itself when you\u2019re creating high-quality educational materials. You start to have those thoughts about providing credentials for people.\u201d\n\nThe project got going more than three years ago, at an educational content creators event where YouTube connected Complexly and ASU. The idea crystallized when the Crash Course team realized that 43 million Americans hold some form of student debt, totaling $1.75 trillion. Of those 43 million people, 40% don\u2019t have a degree, because they never graduated. Some might realize partway through their studies that a college education isn\u2019t for them; for others, life simply gets in the way.\u201cWe decided to look at what the hardest parts are for students, and one of them was the barrier of cost and the barrier of bureaucracy to higher education,\u201d Hank Green said. He pointed out that pretty much anyone can take the courses, including high school students.\n\nViewers can watch the educational videos on the Study Hall YouTube channel for free. Then, if they want to attain college credit, they can go to the Study Hall website and purchase access to the full class, where they\u2019ll be given coursework and get feedback from faculty. The program\u2019s initial cost is $25, which gains a person access to faculty and assessments.\u00a0Once someone completes the assessments and attains the grade they want, they can pay $400 to receive college credit. Users can choose not to take the credit, meaning they\u2019ve only ever spent $25.\u201cFear is a big barrier,\u201d Green said. \u201cHaving a little bit of skin in the game is good with $25, but not an amount that anyone thinks is a large amount for a college course. But lowering that initial barrier of paying $1,200 for a course that I might fail is important.\u201d Doing four courses and getting at least a B in each would give a learner the right to enroll at an official ASU campus or online program.Green said he appreciates the fact that ASU doesn\u2019t game the college ranking systems in the US by aiming for a low acceptance rate. \u201cA long time ago, they turned that on its head and said, \u2018We're going to judge our school not by who we exclude but by how many people we actually help.\u2019 That philosophy is really inspiring to me, and one of the reasons why I felt excited to work with them.\u201d Such collaborations are rare, said Green, who added, \u201cI\u2019m pretty precious about my baby.\u201d\n\nFor its part, ASU is looking forward to welcoming potential students from Study Hall, said Maria Anguiano, executive vice president of learning enterprise at the university. The school, she said, is always \u201cthinking about innovative ways that we can keep adding to our inclusion mission.\u201d The Greens\u2019 program offered just such an opportunity. \u201cWe thought, What if we combined forces and really use each of our superpowers to come together to be able to reach more learners?\u201d she said.\n\nIn a statement provided to BuzzFeed News, Katie Kurtz, YouTube\u2019s head of learning, said, \u201cYouTube learning creators are passionate about making educational content accessible and engaging. They inspire and motivate learners every single day. We're excited to help create new pathways for these learners to turn their learning journey on YouTube into formal education and real-world recognition for their learning.\u201d\n\nSo far, the playlists on Study Hall\u2019s YouTube channel cover topics like data literacy, chemistry, algebra, writing composition, human communication, rhetoric and composition, math, and US history to 1865. The introductory videos are hosted by ASU college students, Green said, in order to make the idea seem less intimidating to those traditionally scared of college.\n\n#### View this video on YouTube\n\nThe number of courses will gradually increase to the point that students could complete their whole first year of college using the program, said Anguiano. She said that ASU is hoping for \u201cthousands\u201d to take up the offer, but added that \u201ccapacity is limitless.\u201d Green said he hoped thousands of students would participate this year, and tens of thousands would be using the program in five years. \u201cThough I have no idea what I\u2019m basing this on,\u201d he admitted.The ability to sign up for classes where you interact with instructors is what separates Study Hall from previous attempts to promote online learning, said Derek Bruff, a higher education consultant and visiting associate director at the University of Mississippi\u2019s Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. \u201cWithout an instructor and classmates, this is just Coursera and edX all over again,\u201d Bruff wrote via Twitter direct message.\n\nBruff is intrigued to see how Study Hall\u2019s learning community works. \u201cThe students who struggle to start and succeed in college need a lot more than good videos and auto-graded exams,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Study Hall can provide an actual learning community at scale for cheap, that would be transformative. But no one has squared that circle yet.\u201d\n\nBruff, however, is hopeful that the high-profile parties involved will mean the project stands a better chance than most of succeeding. \u201cIt's a super-interesting development, and I'm not surprised ASU is involved,\u201d Bruff said. \u201cThey're pushing envelopes left and right. And the Green brothers are treasures.\u201d\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# There\u2019s An Ozempic Shortage. Here's What Happens When You Stop Taking It.\n\nOzempic isn\u2019t a new drug, but the buzz around it is hard to ignore. That buzz is causing a shortage, which can have serious consequences for people with Type 2 diabetes.\n\nCelebrities seeking to lose weight is just one factor driving a worldwide shortage of Ozempic, a drug originally approved to treat Type 2 diabetes that can also result in significant weight loss.\n\n#Ozempic and #OzempicChallenge have over 400 million views combined on TikTok, as people gush about losing weight with the drug. This fall, Andy Cohen called out celebrities using Ozempic for weight loss, tweeting, \u201cEveryone is suddenly showing up 25 pounds lighter. What happens when they stop taking #Ozempic ?????\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an important question. Content creator and model Remi Bader, who was taking the drug because she was prediabetic and had insulin resistance, stopped taking it in 2020 and said it worsened her binge eating. People magazine reported that she gained double the weight back after she ceased taking the drug.\n\nThat answer depends on why you\u2019re taking it, said Archana Sadhu, MD, an endocrinologist and director of the diabetes program at Houston Methodist.\n\nFor people who are trying to lose weight, whether or not they need to, Ozempic will flush out of your body and you\u2019ll go back to where you were, Sadhu said. There\u2019s no withdrawal and you don\u2019t need to taper off the drug, although you may feel hungry again and regain the weight.\n\nBut if you\u2019re taking the drug to manage Type 2 diabetes, the consequences could be life-threatening. Blood sugar will soar almost immediately and could even lead to heart attacks, strokes, kidney damage, and even death, said Sadhu, who is fielding panicked phone calls from people with Type 2 diabetes who are running out or have run out.\n\n## What is Ozempic?\n\nOzempic is a brand name for semaglutide, an injectable medication that the FDA first approved in 2017 for the treatment and management of Type 2 diabetes and heart complications in people with the condition. It was immediately adopted by the medical community to control blood sugar levels, which it does very well. \u201cIt\u2019s much more potent than existing drugs,\u201d Sadhu said.\n\nIn clinical trials, Ozempic turned out to have a side effect: weight loss. It suddenly became attractive to people without Type 2 diabetes who wanted to shed pounds.\n\nThe drug was originally used \u201coff label\u201d as a weight-loss aid but, soon enough (June 2021), the FDA also approved it under the brand name Wegovy for weight loss in people who were overweight or obese, which includes two-thirds of Americans. There\u2019s also a wide overlap between overweight/obesity and Type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut, Sadhu noted, there are strict criteria for using drugs such as Ozempic and others in the same drug class for obesity. \u201cYou have to have a body mass index of 27 and certain chronic conditions like heart disease and fatty liver disease or a body mass index of 30 and above,\u201d Sadhu said. To put that in perspective, someone who is 5\u20195'' tall would need to weigh about 160 pounds to have a BMI of 27 and 180 pounds to have a BMI of 30.\n\n\u201cFor someone who has a BMI of 24 and wants to be 22, the risks don\u2019t outweigh the benefits,\u201d Sadhu said.\n\n## How do Ozempic and Wegovy work?\n\nOzempic is one of a class of medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. These drugs work in multiple ways.\n\n\u201cOne is to go to the brain appetite center to suppress appetite,\u201d Sadhu said. They also delay food emptying from the stomach which makes you feel fuller longer. Most importantly for Type 2, Ozempic is an artificial version of a gut hormone called incretin which helps the pancreas release the right amount of insulin when blood sugar levels are high.\n\nMost people take the shot once a week at dosages ranging between 0.25 milligrams and 2 milligrams per week, said Dr. Andrew Kraftson, director of the post-bariatric endocrinology clinic and weight navigation program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n\n## Wegovy versus Ozempic\n\nThe only difference between Wegovy and Ozempic is their maximum dosage levels (Wegovy is higher) and what they\u2019re approved for, explained Dr. Jamy Ard, codirector of the weight management center at the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.\n\nBoth drugs are semaglutide, but Ozempic is approved to treat Type 2 diabetes, while Wegovy is approved to treat obesity, Ard said. Ozempic\u2019s top weekly dosage is 2 milligrams weekly, while Wegovy\u2019s is 2.4 milligrams.\n\n\u201cAlthough Wegovy and Ozempic both contain semaglutide, they are different products with different indications, dosages, titration schedules, and delivery devices,\u201d a spokesperson for the pharmaceutical Novo Nordisk, which manufactures both drugs, wrote in an email. \u201cThe products are not interchangeable and should not be used outside of their approved indications.\u201d\n\nExperts told us these differences in the medications were negligible.\n\n## Why has Ozempic become so popular, and why is there a shortage of it?\n\nThe surge of interest and resulting shortage in Ozempic has been fueled by a combination of factors.\n\nThe company said it anticipated that the demand for Ozempic would grow, just not at the pace they\u2019re seeing. According to the company\u2019s numbers, usage of the drug grew 69% globally year to date, while usage rates of its weight management medications, which includes Wegovy, grew 75%.\n\nThe experts said the largest factor driving the popularity of Ozempic is how effective Wegovy is and the resulting demand for semaglutide medications. Society\u2019s anti-fat bias and the influence of the weight loss industry on medical professionals, also play a role.\n\n\u201cThe average weight loss drug on the market prior to Wegovy caused 7% to 10% of body weight loss, whereas Wegovy is now topping 15% to 17% body weight loss,\u201d Ard explained.\n\nAn even more effective drug, Mounjaro (the brand name for tirzepatide, which is in a similar class of medications), was approved by the FDA in May 2022, Ard added. At higher doses, Mounjaro can result in losing as much as 20% of your body weight, which is similar to results from bariatric surgery, Sadhu said. But this, too, is headed for shortages.\n\nWhen a medication causes weight loss, there tends to be a word-of-mouth effect, said Dr. Daniel Bessesen, a professor of medicine in the division of endocrinology, metabolism, and diabetes at the University of Colorado\u2019s School of Medicine.\n\nWhen people hear or see that someone has lost weight, they may ask their doctor for the same medication, Bessesen said, adding that many older weight loss meds haven\u2019t had this impact because they\u2019re not as effective.\n\n## A shortage from the start\n\nSoon after Wegovy was released, it was clear that the demand was outstripping supply, Kraftson said. There was also a supply issue regarding the device used to inject Wegovy, Ard added.\n\nOnce the Wegovy shortage began, doctors compensated the best they could. People also quickly realized Ozempic and Wegovy were the same drug under different brand names.\n\n\u201cSince physicians, and now patients, know that Ozempic is the same medication as Wegovy, the workaround [for clinicians] has been to prescribe Ozempic while waiting for the Wegovy backorder to resolve,\u201d Kraftson said.\n\nAs more people and clinicians turned to Ozempic as a replacement for Wegovy, it wasn\u2019t long before a shortage of the former ensued, the experts explained.\n\n## The insurance factor\n\nYou can\u2019t really explain the Ozempic shortage without discussing the insurance angle.\n\nMany health plans don\u2019t cover weight-loss medications, but they do tend to cover diabetes medications, and Ozempic, unlike Wegovy, falls into this category.\n\nDoctors can prescribe Ozempic for obesity off label \u2014 for uses other than its official designation \u2014 allowing people to get coverage for a medication they otherwise couldn\u2019t, Ard said. When companies do require evidence someone needs diabetes treatment, doctors can usually provide blood tests that show someone has poorly regulated blood glucose levels or prediabetes, Bessesen added.\n\nThe off-label prescription use of medications is very common in many areas of medicine. But since health issues related to weight impact so many individuals, and given the publicity surrounding the issue, this case has been generating a lot more attention than normal, Kraftson explained.\n\n## But why do insurance companies cover diabetes medications and not weight management medications?\n\nPart of the reason insurance companies offer less coverage for weight management medications is because they tend to be very expensive, Bessesen explained. He said by far the most widely prescribed weight management drug, phentermine, entered the market around the late 1950s and has maintained its usage status despite only tending to result in 3% to 5% loss of body weight \u2013 primarily for one reason: its low cost.\n\n\u201cPhentermine costs around $10 to $20 a month, whereas semaglutide medications cost more like $1,200 a month,\u201d he said.\n\n## Ozempic versus other weight loss drugs\n\nAdding to this issue is that older-generation weight management drugs were generally not very effective or had risky side issues, encouraging the idea that these medications don\u2019t work well and aren\u2019t worth the risk of an insurance plan covering it, Bessesen described. Yet these concerns are no longer warranted, according to the experts.\n\nThere is an abundance of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of newer anti-obesity medications like Wegovy, Bessesen said. \u201cBut from the perspective of an insurance company, these drugs are extremely expensive. Around 42% of all adults in the US have obesity, and most people need to use these drugs indefinitely.\u201d\n\nWith these factors in mind, the idea of insurance companies trying to provide coverage for everyone who qualifies to take weight loss medications seems near impossible, Bessesen concluded.\n\n## How are shortages affecting patients?\n\nWhen asked whether their patients are affected by Wegovy and Ozempic shortages, the experts were mixed.\n\nDealing with the ramifications of these shortages is a daily hassle, Ard said. \u201cI probably have several emails in my inbox right now with questions like, \u2018Where can I find it?\u2019, \u2018Do you know which pharmacies still have any?\u2019, \u2018How can I get a refill because it\u2019s on backorder?\u2019\u201d\n\nBessesen felt the shortages weren\u2019t as big of an issue based on his experience. \u201cThe shortage seems to be pharmacy-dependent, and to an extent, payment method\u2013dependent,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that the production capacity compared to the demand for these medications has been exceeded.\u201d\n\nFor people with Type 2 diabetes, Sadhu said doctors are having to switch to older, less effective drugs to control blood sugar.\n\n## How long will it take to resolve the Ozempic and Wegovy shortages?\n\nWhen asked when the Ozempic shortage will be resolved, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told us that 1- and 2-milligram doses of Ozempic are now available for patients across the US \u2014 but, due to high demand and global supply chain constraints, the company is still experiencing intermittent supply disruptions on the Ozempic pen that delivers 0.25- and 0.5-milligram doses.\n\nOzempic continues to be manufactured and shipped, the company spokesperson wrote, but patients in some areas of the country will experience delays. They added that the company is making both short- and long-term investments to solve these temporary challenges.\n\nThe spokesperson mentioned that while they recognize that some healthcare providers may be prescribing Ozempic for patients whose goal is to lose weight, it is up to each provider\u2019s discretion to choose the best treatment approach for their patients.\n\nNovo Nordisk said it doesn\u2019t encourage off-label use of its medicines, and is committed to fully complying with all applicable US laws and regulations.\n\nOzempic continues to be manufactured and shipped, the company spokesperson wrote, but patients in some areas of the country will experience delays. They added that the company is making both short- and long-term investments to solve these temporary challenges.\n\n## What do the experts think about celebrities and TikTokers promoting Ozempic for weight loss?\n\nWhen a Twitter user asked Elon Musk in October 2022 what his secret was to looking so \u201cfit, ripped, and healthy,\u201d he replied, \u201cFasting \u2026 And Wegovy.\u201d\n\n(Novo Nordisk said it does not currently work with any celebrities to promote Wegovy.)\n\nArd said he\u2019d be remiss not to mention that part of the demand for Wegovy and Ozempic is being driven by celebrities, and social media influencers using the drug. \u201cAs an obesity medicine specialist,\u201d he said, \u201cI really cringe at this thought.\u201d\n\nWhen these drugs are used for cosmetic, not medical, purposes, it can drive usage rates that create or worsen disparities in medication access, Ard said. In other words, people who don\u2019t really need these medications, but can afford to pay a lot for them, can cause supply issues for people who do need the medication but can\u2019t afford to pay for it outright.\n\nSadhu is imploring people without diabetes to forgo the drug temporarily in favor of those who are desperately sick.\n\nAs for the safety of basing weight-loss treatment decisions off social and celebrity advice, it\u2019s fine to hear about people\u2019s methods of losing weight, but you should treat obesity as you would any other medical condition, Ard said.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t find me seeking advice on how to treat heart disease or cancer from a celebrity or influencer with no medical training,\u201d Ard said. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t turn to these sources for advice on how to lose weight healthfully.\u201d\n\nWhen people hear about celebrities using weight management medications, the story that people absorb is that this is a cosmetic drug, Bessesen added. \u201cThis kind of thinking furthers the engrained idea many people, and society in general, have, that weight is simply a cosmetic, lifestyle issue.\u201d\n\nPeople may think following a good diet or exercise routine can cure health issues related to weight, but this simply isn\u2019t true. \u201cWeight is regulated by a complex biological system, and in most cases people don\u2019t choose what they weigh. The body really has its own idea of what it wants to weigh, and will work to maintain or return to that weight,\u201d Bessesen said. This means that once you stop taking weight loss medications, you\u2019ll probably regain all the weight you lost.\n\nBessesen explained that he sees obesity as a biological weight regulation problem and wishes more people \u2014 including clinicians \u2014 would view it this way.\n\n## How to get help\n\nThe experts suggested that for people looking to treat obesity or get rid of excess weight, a good first step is to talk with their family doctor.\n\nBear in mind that even with medication, or bariatric surgery for that matter, diet and exercise still play an outsize role in weight management. \u201cThe effect of these medications goes away immediately when you stop them,\u201d Sadhu said. \u201cYou have to be building long-term healthy lifestyle habits.\u201d\n\nIf you feel like you\u2019re not getting the support or level of advice you need from your doctor, look for a provider who specializes in treating obesity, Ard said. Many family doctors don\u2019t get special training in how to treat the condition.\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble finding an expert, you can search for specialists in your area using a portal provided by the Obesity Medicine Association.\n\n## More on this\n\nJennifer Huizen is a health contributor for BuzzFeed News.

        "article": "# MrBeast Built A YouTube Empire On Being Mr. Nice Guy, But His Stunt Helping 1,000 Blind People Divided Viewers, Who Called It \"Demonic\"\n\nIs it stunt philanthropy or self-funded charity in the YouTube age?\n\nA YouTuber just helped treat 1,000 people with blindness and low vision. Why are people so upset about it?\u00a0\n\nMrBeast, a 24-year-old whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is the highest-earning creator on the platform with a record-breaking 131 million subscribers. His fame was a slow build at first. He started posting at age 13 and says he carefully studied other creators and his own stats to create the most watchable content possible. His repertoire now includes dramatic displays of charitable giving, with videos like \u201cPlanting 20,000,000 Trees, My Biggest Project Ever!\u201d and \u201cI Cleaned the World\u2019s Dirtiest Beach #TeamSeas.\u201d\u00a0\n\n#### View this video on YouTube\n\nBut his latest video has divided fans. In a Jan. 28 video called \u201c1,000 Blind People See for the First Time,\u201d surgeon Jeff Levenson explained to MrBeast that \u201chalf of all the blindness in the world\u201d can be treated with a 10-minute surgery. MrBeast announced that he would be helping 1,000 people undergo that operation. The video shows how many of those patients reacted to being able to see more clearly \u2014 with delighted screams and tears. A counter on the screen assigns each patient a number out of 1,000.\n\nOne woman expressed her shock that MrBeast would pay for her surgery, and he presented her with an additional suitcase filled with $10,000. She screamed and fell to the ground. He made sure a man\u2019s son was the first thing he saw after the operation. The YouTuber surprised another man, who said he\u2019d missed driving after his vision became blurry, with a new Tesla.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAppreciate all you do to help others. You are setting a great example for the community Jimmy,\u201d one person commented. \u201cHealing the blind now? You can easily say he's gonna be the best content creator for the coming years. Mad respect!\u201d another wrote.\u00a0\n\nOn Twitter, there were a number of negative responses accusing MrBeast of \u201cusing\u201d disabled people and people with low incomes to generate views and likening his video to \u201ccharity porn.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere is something so demonic about this and I can\u2019t even articulate what it is,\u201d one user wrote.\n\n\u201cMr Beast has been making exploitative content for awhile now. \u2026 He uses vulnerable and desperate people for content,\u201d another tweeted. \u201cDoesn't make him a good person for making that happen.\u201d\n\nhas no one talked about the mr beast thing wrt inspiration porn and disability or did I just miss it\n\nIt\u2019s the never ending cycle of content creation that makes Mr Beast feel insidious. The underlying notion that if the camera wasn\u2019t on to feed the machine nothing would happen. The dystopian thought we\u2019re reliant on YouTube views instead of competent government for assistance.\n\nAre his good deeds still good if they make him a lot of money? This act of stunt philanthropy was engineered for public consumption, and its 76 million views directly translate to ad revenue for MrBeast\u2019s team. He also spent a lot of money on producing, filming, and editing this video.\u00a0\n\nMrBeast said in a tweet that it\u2019s his goal to give away all his money before he dies. He implied that he didn\u2019t understand the backlash to his video.\u00a0\n\nTwitter - Rich people should help others with their money\n\nMe - Okay, I\u2019ll use my money to help people and I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.\n\nTwitter - MrBeast bad\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why curable blindness is a thing. Why don\u2019t governments step in and help? Even if you\u2019re thinking purely from a financial standpoint it\u2019s hard to see how they don\u2019t roi on taxes from people being able to work again,\u201d he wrote in another tweet.\u00a0\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of MrBeast to varying degrees. The New York Times reported that he has berated his employees. He made anti-gay jokes on Twitter as recently as 2017, and he\u2019s a young and powerful business owner who idolizes Elon Musk. And, of course, there\u2019s the question of his intentions when creating stunt philanthropy content.\u00a0\n\nAnother huge problem: MrBeast's video seems to regard disability as something that needs to be solved. He doesn't say in the video or in any of his subsequent public statements whether he consulted with the video's subjects about how they felt to have their disability treated as a problem. That's something that's been argued over in the days since the video was uploaded.\n\n\u201cIf Mr Beast TRULY wanted to do something good and TRULY cares about disabled people, he wouldn\u2019t monetize their suffering and make them tap dance on video just so he can slap it up on YouTube,\u201d healthcare advocate Kendall Brown tweeted.\n\nIf you wanna see a microcosm of how the ableist mindset pervades society writ large, check out the replies to Mr. Beast\u2019s tweet on disabled people being ROIs. \n\nThey essentially say disabilities are a failure of the human condition and thus require eradication.\n\nSteve Saylor, who is blind, tweeted that MrBeast just seems to be \u201cputting his money where his mouth is.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cI see what I call \u2018inspiration porn\u2019 videos all the time. Where it's designed to highlight \u2018the struggle\u2019 of disabled people to tug at the heart strings. Mr. Beast isn't doing that,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat MrBeast is turning charity work into content is also frustrating people on Twitter.\n\nthe entire mrbeast discourse in one picture\n\nthe chronically online: rich ppl should help the poor\n\nmr beast: *helps the poor*\n\neveryone:\n\nTwitch commentator Hasan Piker streamed his reaction to MrBeast\u2019s video, which he said filled him with \u201crage.\u201d He added that people shouldn\u2019t be mad at the YouTuber; they should be mad at the system that created such a drastic need.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe shut off access to a 10-minute procedure because we paywalled it and decided that some people just can\u2019t get it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so insanely frustrating that it\u2019s up to one YouTube guy to decide to make content about it.\u201d\n\nI think that the outrage needs to be directed to the circumstances that allowed MrBeast to create stunt philanthropy content in the first place. Do we as a society see disabilities as problems that need to be solved? Is it ethical to use the people who receive charity in content that is consumed as entertainment? Why is a YouTuber starting conversations about the lack of accessible healthcare more effectively than billionaires or politicians? Should videos like this not exist, or should they not have to exist?\n\nI don\u2019t know, but I hate it here.\u00a0\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# What Happens When You Become Viral Content Without Your Consent\n\nIn an age where camera phones are ubiquitous and the lure of internet popularity is a chronic condition, everything \u2014 and everyone \u2014 is content.\n\nTimothy Goodman was oblivious to the camera being pointed at him. It was September in New York, and Goodman, an artist and graphic designer, was near his art studio, getting lunch or walking home; he doesn\u2019t remember exactly. What he didn\u2019t realize, until days later when friends sent him a TikTok, was that he was being filmed by someone from inside a moving car.\n\nThe video shows Goodman and another man waiting to cross the street. You can\u2019t see Goodman\u2019s face because he\u2019s looking down at his phone, but the man behind him looks right at the camera. The text overlaid on the video suggests that one of the men had lied to bail on a date and was caught in the act: \u201cwhen he texts u that he can\u2019t do dinner because he\u2019s out of town for work but u see him crossing the streets while ur in ur Uber.\u201d\n\nWhen friends sent Goodman the TikTok, he was confused \u2014 though a little bemused \u2014 to find himself the subject of a viral video. But the premise was fake: He didn\u2019t know the person who made the TikTok, Ellery Lee, and he was in a happy, long-term relationship with his girlfriend.\n\nTimothy Goodman in front of a mural he designed near Washington Square Park in Manhattan on Feb. 7, 2023.\n\nBut nobody on TikTok knew that. In the comments, people viciously insulted Goodman and the other man\u2019s appearance. Meanwhile, Lee was responding to commenters telling them to wait for the full story.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s egging it on like I\u2019m really her man and this whole thing was real,\u201d Goodman told BuzzFeed News. \u201cAnd then I got kind of upset.\u201d\n\nThe video racked up more than a million views on TikTok before Lee finally removed it a few days later.\u00a0\n\nIn a TikTok responding to Lee\u2019s video, Goodman made an emphatic plea. \u201cThis is a viral video with hundreds of comments of people talking about how disgusting I look and how skinny I am, and how she can do so much better. And I would just say that like, maybe we don\u2019t have to make fun of people\u2019s appearances, complete strangers, online,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaybe we also shouldn\u2019t be like, posting people \u2014 strangers \u2014 online without their consent.\u201d\n\nWhat happened to Goodman has become increasingly common in an age where camera phones are ubiquitous and the desire for internet clout is chronic. We film ourselves, we film our surroundings, we film the people we know and the people we don\u2019t, and we post freely and carelessly. This is the age of panopticontent \u2014 everything is content for the creating, and everyone is a nonplayer character in my world.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in sort of a self-induced surveillance state, where no longer is it necessarily the government panopticon, but it\u2019s now everyone else getting their phones out and filming and surveilling, constantly,\u201d Jenna Drenten, an associate professor in the Quinlan School of Business at the Loyola University Chicago who studies digital consumer culture, told BuzzFeed News.\u00a0\n\nOur appetite to document and post \u2014 whether it\u2019s ethical or not \u2014 is reinforced by the seduction of social media fame. There are whole genres of online content in which people are being recorded or photographed without their knowledge or consent \u2014 on the subway, at a shopping center, in a car, on the sidewalk, at a restaurant, at a bar. Many of these videos present strangers as NPCs, or nonplayer characters, an internet term referring to people who aren\u2019t seen as fully realized individuals and are simply part of the backdrop. These strangers are displayed as a spectacle to gawk at and be judged by an audience of millions around the world: People experiencing homelessness are objects of pity and disgust. A couple making out in public are objects of ridicule.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn the larger context of things, it\u2019s just a big problem, like people will [want to] go viral at any cost these days,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s the subject or what it might mean to their life.\u201d\n\nLee, an influencer with 30,000 followers on TikTok, said her content is meant to be self-deprecating and relatable. She told BuzzFeed News that the last thing she expected when she posted her video was for it to get back to any of the people in it. But that\u2019s the thing about TikTok; by virtue of the app\u2019s For You page, users are served content from anyone, anywhere, and videos can go massively viral regardless of a creator\u2019s follower count. It also exposes people to a sudden, mammoth level of popularity, and consequently an audience hungry to investigate, speculate, and scrutinize.\n\nDocumenting people in their everyday lives and turning it into online content is not new. Blogs like People of Walmart, which shared user-submitted photos of unsuspecting Walmart shoppers, were early iterations of this phenomenon in the late aughts.\u00a0\n\nBut thanks to apps like TikTok, the reach of social platforms is larger than ever before, and our online social circles are far more expansive. We\u2019re no longer just privy to the social media lives of our friends, family, acquaintances, and celebrities; we are now giving strangers access to our lives \u2014 and everyone in it \u2014 and inviting them to watch and participate.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s sort of instant gratification and a reward for the person that can post that content,\u201d Drenten said. \u201cThey get to have a viral video and become popular for a moment in time.\u201d\n\nOur ability to instantly film and post on social media has not just been a source of entertainment, it\u2019s also been used as a powerful social tool. Ordinary citizens documenting police interactions or acts of discrimination has enabled us to hold people and institutions in power accountable, including if laws fail to do so. But turning the camera on each other for entertainment can lead people into ethically murky territory.\n\nIt\u2019s generally legal to film and photograph people in public, and there\u2019s little legal recourse for people unhappy about their image being captured in a public space. \u201cIt is a bit inevitable that we are constantly watching and being watched,\u201d Drenten said. \u201cIn public spaces, your image is always up for grabs.\u201d\n\nPrivate citizens can bring a false light claim against someone for intentionally or recklessly misrepresenting their image in a highly offensive way, but those are high bars to clear and it costs a lot of money to take someone to court, Mark Bartholomew, a law professor at the University at Buffalo who focuses on online privacy, told BuzzFeed News. (Celebrities have a higher burden of proof when they bring a defamation claim against the paparazzi, for example, because they are voluntary public figures and generally have more resources to combat false narratives about themselves.)\u00a0\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re in the public area, there\u2019s a lot of freedom for people to record you without your permission,\u201d Bartholomew said.\u00a0\n\nAnd while it\u2019s legally true that there is no expectation of privacy in public spaces, it\u2019s reasonable for people to expect that their photo won\u2019t be taken and shared online simply because they leave their house that day, said Casey Fiesler, an associate professor in the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, who specializes on information ethics and law, and online communities.\n\nAlthough it is in our nature to want to self-document, social media often magnifies our worst tendencies, Bartholomew argued. \u201cThese entities like TikTok, they\u2019re not rewarding thoughtful curation and documenting. They\u2019re rewarding, sexy, controversial, snarky videos that generate views,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people have these good human impulses to curate, to document, to share, and the platform does help you do that. But at the same time, I think it pushes these darker impulses as well.\u201d\n\nTikTok has certainly emboldened our pursuit of attention, but viewers are not blameless here either. Every time we watch a video, share it with our group chats, write a comment, and post it on another platform, we are willing participants in an increasingly toxic ecosystem. TikTok\u2019s For You page is engineered to distinguish between content you engage with and content you don\u2019t, so if you\u2019re served multiple videos of strangers being recorded, it\u2019s likely because the app\u2019s fiercely effective algorithm has figured out that that content occupies your attention.\u00a0\n\nIn the grand scheme of our surveillance state, when public and private entities, including TikTok, pose a bigger threat to our privacy and harvest our data in troubling ways, maybe becoming the main character of the day online isn\u2019t the end of the world. But the casual resignation around how our data is used may explain why we\u2019re increasingly comfortable surveilling each other.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re constantly under watch, it sort of is more OK, I think, to point your camera at someone else without permission and post it,\u201d Bartholomew said. \u201cI think our sense of privacy is gradually declining.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWhen Lee took out her phone to record that day in the Uber, she said she just randomly filmed people on the street and slapped a caption on the video without thinking twice. As her TikTok became viral, she saw that people were invested in the story and wanted to know more. So she went along with it, telling people to stay tuned for updates.\n\n\u201cIt was just to play into that story because at the end of the day, it was a character I was playing on TikTok. You kind of like, want to [draw] them in,\u201d she said. She frequently posts comedic videos about dating where she\u2019s on the losing end, like dancing behind text that reads \u201cme after he texts at 12am asking wyd after ghosting me for 3 months.\u201d It\u2019s a narrative she\u2019s created for content \u2014\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m embarrassing myself.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s viral video is an example of what Drenten calls story-making, a popular form of social media content in which fictionalized or speculative context is added. Story-making content can seem like an innocuous expression of main character syndrome (a self-absorbed person who identifies as the protagonist in their life), but it can also have unintended consequences, like in Goodman\u2019s case.\n\nAfter Goodman responded to her TikTok, it was flooded with comments criticizing her for filming strangers without their consent and for making up the story. Lee removed the TikTok and made an apology video. \u201cI do agree that having consent is something that should be explored in all social media platforms. Please note that my intentions were never to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings in the making of this video,\u201d she said. (Lee later deleted that apology video too, after being criticized for saying consent should be \u201cexplored.\u201d)\u00a0\n\nThe backlash she received over that incident was intense, and she told BuzzFeed News that she got death threats. Though the experience has taught her to recenter herself and not others in her content, Lee thinks being filmed in public \u2014 with or without permission \u2014\u00a0is bound to happen.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t avoid it. Everyone has a smartphone and camera,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what our generation does.\u201d\n\nLilly Simon was coming home from work in July 2022 when a stranger filmed her on the subway. Simon has neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic condition that causes tumors to grow along her nerves, which look like bumps on her skin. It was the height of the mpox outbreak in New York City, and the person who posted the TikTok zoomed in on the bumps on Simon\u2019s skin and overlaid an emoji of a monkey and a question mark on the video, insinuating that she had mpox.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much engagement that video received, but it was popular enough that Simon\u2019s sister saw it days later and alerted her to it. By then, there was a flood of comments from people mocking her for wearing shorts and being out in public, even threatening her life.\u00a0\n\nWhen Simon saw the TikTok, she told BuzzFeed News her childhood memories of people making fun of her came rushing back. Then she got angry.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had to deal with people like the people in the comments section of this video, and, of course, the person who posted this,\u201d Simon said in a TikTok responding to that video. \u201cI will not let any of you all reverse years of therapy and healing that I had to endure to deal with the condition and, of course, with this around people like you.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSimon received a lot of support on her TikTok, and she told BuzzFeed News that she\u2019s proud to have helped raise awareness about her condition. But she still struggled with being known for something she tried her whole life to hide.\n\nThough the person who posted it reached out to her on TikTok, Simon said she ignored their efforts to get in touch. \u201cI don\u2019t really remember some of the things that he said,\u201d she told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI don\u2019t think \u2018sorry\u2019 was one of them.\u201d The TikTok was eventually taken down. But whether or not the original poster apologized, Simon said the damage was already done.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe video is out there. It\u2019s shared. It\u2019s posted. The internet goes on forever,\u201d Simon said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reversing that.\u201d\n\nEven if the content posted isn\u2019t overtly cruel, it can still be blatantly self-serving at the expense of others. Harrison Pawluk, an Australian TikToker with 3.4 million followers, went viral last June for recording himself giving flowers to a woman at a shopping center, framing it as an act of kindness. In his video, he approaches the woman and asks her to hold a bouquet of flowers as he puts his jacket on. Then he walks away, leaving the flowers with her.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI hope this made her day better [heart emoji],\u201d he wrote in the caption, along with the hashtag #wholesome.\u00a0\n\nPawluk added dramatic music to make the video more emotionally charged, and his stunt was praised by commenters as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201csweet.\u201d But the woman who was filmed, Maree (she declined to share her last name), later told ABC Radio Melbourne that she never agreed to participate, and she felt \u201cdehumanized\u201d by the encounter.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThese artificial things are not random acts of kindness,\u201d she said. \u201cHe interrupted my quiet time, filmed and uploaded a video without my consent, turning it into something it wasn\u2019t, and I feel like he is making quite a lot of money through it.\u201d\n\nMore than 13 million people liked the video. Pawluk apologized after Maree\u2019s interview aired, but said he won\u2019t stop making videos that \u201cinspire\u201d people to \u201cdo something good.\u201d That video continues to live on his TikTok account.\n\nContent like Pawluk\u2019s is meant to elevate the creator as the protagonist in the story, Drenten said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it's making the content creator the hero of the story,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they get all the eyeballs on the internet and they get the attention at the cost of somebody else.\u201d\n\nAnd being surreptitiously documented can be unpleasant no matter your level of fame. Keke Palmer tweeted about a fan who filmed her in public even though she turned down their repeated request for photos. Bad Bunny hurled a fan\u2019s phone in the water after they tried to take a selfie with him.\u00a0\n\nWhen Sarah Isenberg, a 24-year-old microinfluencer who mostly posts fashion content on her Instagram and TikTok, was recognized in a stranger\u2019s vlog of their day in New York City, she said she felt uneasy. She was filmed crossing a street in someone else\u2019s TikTok and while her face isn\u2019t shown in the video, a follower clocked her outfit \u2014 which she had shared on Instagram \u2014 and tagged her in it.\n\nIsenberg is no stranger to people recognizing her from social media or asking for a photo of her outfit. But this felt different, she said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI felt really uncomfortable that, one, somebody has taken this video of me without my knowledge and without my consent to post it to the internet, and now people on the internet who I don\u2019t know are recognizing me in this video without even my face being in it,\u201d she told BuzzFeed News.\u00a0\n\nIsenberg knew the person who filmed her meant no harm. Less than 6,000 people saw the TikTok, a relatively minuscule amount of views for a video on the app. But the experience unnerved her. It was as if she was being watched, but she didn\u2019t know from where and by whom.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn the plainest of terms, it kind of felt Truman Show\u2013y,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere everybody else is in on this, but I\u2019m not.\u201d \u25cf\n\n",

        "article": "# The Man Who Lost His Ski Crash Lawsuit Against Gwyneth Paltrow Said He Regrets It\n\nTurns out, beyond having to pay $1 and legal expenses after losing in court, suing an ultrafamous celebrity can have other consequences.\n\nTerry Sanderson, the Utah man suing Gwyneth Paltrow, enters court at the trial on March 29, 2023, in Park City.\n\nThings didn\u2019t go as planned for Terry Sanderson, who sued Gwyneth Paltrow for a 2016 Utah ski crash at Deer Valley Resort.\n\nAfter a jury on Thursday found that the Oscar-winning actor was not liable for the crash and that, as a result, Sanderson would have to pay her $1 and her legal expenses, he expressed regret outside the courthouse.\u00a0\n\nWhen a reporter asked the 76-year-old retired optometrist if the live-televised trial, which included testimony from his daughters and ex-girlfriend, was worth it, he replied, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\"Knowing that now, no,\" Terry said in a video shared by Extra. \"I joked about dating sites, right? It's like, I'm gonna be on the internet forever.\"\n\nActor Gwyneth Paltrow sits in court during her civil trial over a collision with another skier on March 29 in Park City, Utah.\u00a0\n\nSanderson filed the lawsuit against Paltrow in 2019, accusing her of crashing into him while not paying attention to her surroundings at the ski resort. He initially sued for $3 million, but that amount was reduced to over $300,000 prior to the trial.\n\nPaltrow\u2019s attorneys, however, argued that Sanderson only sued because of the actor\u2019s wealth and fame. During the trial \u2014\u00a0which transfixed viewers with courtroom quips and Paltrow\u2019s daily fashion choices \u2014\u00a0the actor testified that Sanderson actually crashed into her. Paltrow also described how she initially thought she was being sexually assaulted and that she \u201conly heard a male voice.\"\n\nBefore the case was sent to the jury, which deliberated for just a few hours before rendering a verdict, Paltrow also explained that she only countersued for $1 as a symbolic gesture \u201cbecause the damages would actually be more.\u201d\u00a0\n\nGwyneth Paltrow speaks with retired optometrist Terry Sanderson after the verdict was read in his $300,000 suit against her over a skiing accident, on March 30 in Park City, Utah.\u00a0\n\nWhen it was all said and done, however, Paltrow had one more gesture to deliver, which became an instant meme.\n\nIn an exchange caught on video, Paltrow stopped to lean over to Sanderson on her way out of the courtroom, telling him, \u201cI wish you well.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSanderson said he replied, \u201cThank you, dear.\u201d\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Alex Murdaugh\u2019s Murder Trial Took A 180-Degree Turn After Questions About Possible Drug Gang Involvement In The Killings\n\nThe questions led the judge at Alex Murdaugh\u2019s trial to change his mind on whether jurors should hear about the defendant\u2019s alleged botched suicide-for-hire plot.\n\nAlex Murdaugh in court on Wednesday\n\nAlex Murdaugh\u2019s murder trial took a 180-degree turn on Wednesday afternoon after the South Carolina judge reversed a ruling he had made just a few hours earlier regarding the admissibility of evidence related to the defendant\u2019s alleged botched suicide plot.\n\nShortly after beginning proceedings at the Colleton County Courthouse on Wednesday, Judge Clifton Newman initially announced he would prohibit jurors from hearing evidence about Alex\u2019s alleged botched attempt to hire a contract killer, Curtis \u201cEddie\u201d Smith, to fatally shoot him by the side of an isolated rural road months after his wife, Maggie, and son Paul were fatally shot.\n\nThe morning\u2019s ruling had been a rare win for the defense team after extensive evidence about a string of other alleged financial crimes was allowed to be admitted in order to prove a motive for murder. Here, though, Newman said that he believed that allowing evidence of the roadside shooting would instead mainly go to casting Alex\u2019s character as violent. As such, the judge said, it would go against a state rule of criminal procedure that excludes unfairly prejudicial evidence.\n\n\u201cI believe that to allow this evidence in is a bridge too far,\u201d Newman said.\u00a0\n\nHowever, the judge warned he was only granting the motion to exclude the evidence for now, noting that previous questions from Alex\u2019s defense team to witnesses under cross-examination have opened the door to new lanes of evidence being admitted.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOf course, as we have seen, things change,\u201d Newman said.\n\nWell, change things did.\u00a0\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the judge said he was reversing his earlier order to exclude the evidence following questions from Alex\u2019s defense team to the lead state investigator, which Newman determined had \u201copened the door\u201d for the jury to hear about the roadside incident.\u00a0\n\nJudge Clifton Newman on Wednesday\n\nDefense attorney Jim Griffin had asked David Owen, an agent with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), whether he learned during the investigation that Alex, a now-disbarred attorney, had been paying as much as $50,000 per week to Smith, a distant cousin and former client, for drugs. Smith had, in turn, allegedly been procuring the drugs from a local gang and now owed them money.\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid you ever conduct a cellphone analysis of these drug gang members to see where they were on the night of June 7?\u201d Griffin asked Owen.\u00a0\n\nThe SLED agent replied that he did not have their phone numbers, but that agents did check electronic records for any phones identified near the crime scene and that they only identified those of first responders.\u00a0\n\nGriffin also asked Owen whether any DNA evidence was taken from these drug gang members to check whether it matched evidence found under Maggie\u2019s fingernails. Owen said they did not.\n\nFollowing those questions, Newman said he would now permit witnesses to be called about the roadside incident in order for the jury to have a fuller picture of the relationship between Smith and Alex.\u00a0\n\nMarian Proctor on Tuesday\n\nIt was the second time in as many days that the 12 jurors heard hints about the roadside incident but were not provided with extensive evidence about it.\u00a0\n\nIn testimony on Tuesday, Marian Proctor, Maggie\u2019s sister, told jurors that she had been fearful after Maggie and Paul, were fatally shot in June 2021 because she believed they might have been murdered in retribution for a fatal boat crash that Paul allegedly caused two years prior. But Proctor said she found it strange that Alex did not appear to be afraid that he would be targeted next.\n\nTwo months after Maggie and Paul were killed, Proctor said she was horrified to learn that Alex, too, had been shot. She feared the family was being picked off one by one. \u201cI had just lost two of the family members and I felt like they were being targeted at that point,\u201d Proctor told the jury.\n\nBut Alex was only slightly injured in the roadside shooting and Proctor said that when she learned he\u2019d been fired from his law firm the previous day for stealing vast sums of money, her perception of things changed.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat specifically changed your perception of the roadside shooting after your initial concern?\u201d lead prosecutor Creighton Waters asked her.\n\n\u201cThe story that was initially told about what happened [by Alex] came to not be true,\u201d she responded.\u00a0\n\nHowever, Proctor\u2019s testimony ended at that point, and she was not allowed to expand on the false story Alex had told first responders about being shot by an unknown assailant as he changed a car tire. She also did not say that both Alex and Smith were subsequently charged over the scheme, which was allegedly intended to ensure Alex\u2019s surviving son, Buster, would receive an insurance payout.\n\nIn arguing that evidence about the roadside shooting should be permitted, Waters told the judge in a hearing on Wednesday morning without the jury present that it was relevant to their suggestion that Alex had killed his wife and son \u2014 ostensibly aware that people would suspect the murders would be linked to the boat crash \u2014 in order to divert attention from his financial misdeeds that were close to being discovered. There was a \u201csymmetry\u201d between the two events, Waters argued.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe side of the road [shooting] happens and everyone's rushing to Alex Murdaugh\u2019s aid again,\u201d Waters said. \u201cThe fact that he had just been exposed for embezzlement is quickly forgotten about and of course, everybody's assuming, Oh my gosh, it must be the real bad guys, when in fact, it was him all along.\u201d\n\nConversely, in his arguments on Wednesday morning, defense attorney Dick Harpootlian said prosecutors were trying to use the roadside shooting evidence as a \u201cdistraction\u201d to tarnish Alex\u2019s character and not to prove a motive.\n\nAlex had not intended to survive the scheme, Harpootlian said, and only lived because the bullet flew 1 millimeter too far to the left. As a suicide plot, it thus differed greatly from the prosecution\u2019s suggestion that Alex comes up with violent schemes in order to divert attention from himself, Harpootlian said.\n\n\u201cOnce he realizes he\u2019s still alive, he tells that story, but obviously he didn\u2019t intend to be alive,\u201d Harpootlian said. \u201cIn other words, there\u2019s not a scheme that was concocted at any point. If it\u2019s a scheme, it was concocted after he realized he wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d\n\nBut once Griffin asked Owen about Smith on Wednesday afternoon, prosecutor John Meadors seized the chance to ask the SLED agent about how Alex only mentioned Smith and the drug gang as possible suspects in the murders of his wife and son after the roadside incident.\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid he mention anybody else who could\u2019ve done this, who could\u2019ve been involved in it, who could\u2019ve killed \u2018my wife and my son\u2019 from June 7, 2021, until September of \u201921? Did he ever mention anybody else?\u201d Meadors asked Owen, banging his first on a table and yelling for emphasis.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, he did not,\u201d Owen replied.\n\nSLED special agent David Owen on Wednesday\n\nPrior to their questions to Owen about Smith, Alex\u2019s defense team had worked to poke holes in the SLED team\u2019s collection of evidence, noting, for example, that they took months to search Alex\u2019s parents' home and had never asked him for clothes he was seen wearing in a Snapchat video Paul had filmed earlier that night.\u00a0\n\nOwen also admitted that he presented evidence to a local grand jury he later found out to be untrue regarding supposed blood spatter on a shirt Alex had been wearing. A test Owen was later informed of showed there was no human blood on the shirt.\u00a0\n\nAfter roughly three weeks of testimony, prosecutors have signaled they intend to try to wrap up their case by Thursday, at which time defense attorneys may begin to call their own witnesses.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear if Alex himself will take the stand.\n\n## \nUPDATE\n\n\nThis post has been updated with the judge reversing his motion.\n\n## Alex Murdaugh Trial\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# This Viral, Fruit-Headed Doll And Its Tiny Penis Is Everyone\u2019s Emotional Support Crutch\n\nLife is so hard. Get a little naked cherub doll to make it better.\n\nReporting From\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 On Sunday, a crowd of more than 100 people in Washington Square Park unfurled picnic blankets and meticulously arranged the contents of their baskets on them. This was not your average weekend picnic; this was business. Hundreds of Sonny Angels, tiny little plastic cherubs with tubby little stomachs, microscopic penises, and helmets depicting plants or animals, lay ready to be traded.\n\nTwo girls swapped a monkey-headed doll for a flower-headed one. One attendee offered up a chicken-headed doll for $10. Another rushed between groups, trying to offload a doll with a beige-colored boar head. \u201cDoes anyone want to take this uribou Sonny Angel?\u201d she called out.\n\nAmid the hubbub, the Sonny Angel meetup organizer, Erika Saito, greeted attendees enthusiastically, sitting in a white dress among her carefully curated rows of Sonny Angels. \u201cI\u2019m so nervous,\u201d Saito, 20, told BuzzFeed News. After a video about the February meetup garnered over 194,000 views, 100 people signed up for the April one. \u201cThis is the most people we\u2019ve ever had come,\u201d she said. \u201cThe last meetup was like, 15 to 20 people. My mom told me to get my lashes done.\u201d\n\nAttendees meet up to sell and trade Sonny Angels in Washington Square Park in New York City on April 2, 2023.\n\nSonny Angels were first released in 2005 but in recent years have taken the internet by storm. Looking like a cross between an old-school Kewpie baby and a troll doll, #sonnyangels now has 39 million views on TikTok. Bella Hadid recently posted them on her Instagram, the crucial lead image in a curated photo dump.\u00a0\n\nThe dolls are designed to be more than a child\u2019s toy \u2014 they\u2019re meant to be a \u201csmall boyfriend,\u201d according to the official website, a companion that \u201cbrings you healing and a smile.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey just have funny little faces,\u201d the meetup co-organizer, Yunuen Cho, said. \u201cThey\u2019re giving a little side-eye. You look at them, you bring them out with you. They\u2019re on your table. And you\u2019re wondering, Why is he looking at me like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just have funny little faces,\u201d said\u00a0Yunuen Cho, co-organizer of the meetup.\n\nCho, 24, used to work at a high-powered law firm in midtown Manhattan. She\u2019d take herself on a walk when she felt sad and overwhelmed. One day, she passed by a window display of Sonny Angels. They made her smile, and she bought one on the spot. \u201cI showed my law firm coworkers and they were like, \u2018You know what, I want one too,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nBuying Sonny Angels quickly became a ritual between Cho and her coworkers \u2014 every Friday, they would leave their desks and get a new Angel together. Her collection grew. She started posting it on her TikTok, @cutesonnyangel, and after leaving the law firm, she organized meetups with Saito, where a group of women would go to a small business to buy Sonny Angels together.\u00a0\n\nIn part, the dolls are fun because there\u2019s an element of mystery; you can select from different themed \u201cseries,\u201d such as flowers or desserts, but you\u2019ll never exactly know which one you get until you open the box. And they\u2019ve sparked a loyal online community, dedicated to niche fandom lore, comedy skits, and finding clothes for the zany little toys. But it\u2019s more than that.\u00a0\n\nFan Sarah Stansel, 25, pulled out a bubble-headed hydrangea doll from their bag at the meetup, separate from their basket of dolls to trade. \u201cHeidi comes with me everywhere,\u201d they said, showing BuzzFeed News the purple-helmeted baby. \u201cThis is my emotional support.\u201d\n\nThe scene at an.m\u00e9, picking out Sonny Angels\n\nSonny Angels meetup attendees on April 2, 2023, in New York City\n\nSonny Angel retailer Annie Ju, whose toy store an.m\u00e9 in New York sponsored the meetup, said that most of the customers through her store are young working women. \u201cThey come during the lunch hour,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole office is doing this thing. It makes me laugh and sometimes makes me tear up, because they come in as friends. It\u2019s like Christmas every day.\u201d\n\nModern young women are facing an increasingly volatile world. Almost 60% of teen girls have experienced persistent depression, a 2023 CDC study found, and more girls are encountering sexual violence before they turn 18. Gen Z is graduating into a grim labor market, and work seems to feel increasingly pointless to young people. They crave intimacy in a world that is more isolated than ever \u2014 left to deal with the mental burdens of quarantine, climate disasters, and gun violence both in their own lives and through their screens.\n\nAn employee of an.m\u00e9 controls the line to enter the store.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to be outside, and it\u2019s hard to be outside in New York,\u201d Cho said. \u201cIf I\u2019m eating food and my Sonny Angel\u2019s standing next to it, it makes the food almost more photogenic and appetizing for me.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, many of the attendees shared similar stories of what comfort these dolls provided for them. \u201cI think my therapist literally asked me that,\u201d Cho said. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018Why is it so important to you?\u2019 I think they\u2019re a little bit of a crutch. That sounds negative, but I feel like they add to the experience.\u201d\n\nOne, who said she\u2019d prefer not to be named because she didn\u2019t want her parents to know she smoked, opened up about how buying and trading Sonny Angels has been helpful in kicking her nicotine addiction. \u201cI bought one when I felt weak, and it motivated me,\u201d she said. Saito said having her doll out in class takes away from the stress of studying, and has been a conversation starter with many of her classmates.\u00a0\n\nSonny Angels on display at an.m\u00e9\n\nAttendee Judy Gao, 20, said she met Saito in the dorms of NYU. Gao moved from Singapore to New York in 2021 and quickly experienced isolation in the new school, new city, and new country. She said handling her fears of COVID and rampant Asian hate crimes was overwhelming. \u201cThe worst was I moved to New York by myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just so lonely.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThings changed when she met Saito, who had moved from Japan and was feeling many of those same emotions. One day, Saito brought back a Sonny Angel for Gao. \u201cIt reminded me of home,\u201d Saito said.\n\nCynthia LaForte, a psychotherapist with an attachment-based and object relations\u2013based approach, told BuzzFeed News that items can offer a tangible form of security. \u201cWhen children have a doll or blankie, what we call a transitionary object, the object helps the child. And as the child grows up, the object becomes internalized,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a lot of discussion about how things like phones are transitionary objects, giving us a personal sense of safety, love, peace.\u201d\n\nThe meetup is sort of about the dolls, but not really. People hugged longtime internet friends, finally meeting up IRL after chatting on Discord, or traded social media handles with new ones. Some said hi to their favorite Sonny Angel influencers, offering up their bags of tradable dolls.\n\nSonny Angels meetup co-organizer\u00a0Yunuen Cho\n\nLeft: Erika Saito, Sonny Angel meetup organizer, in Washington Square Park on April 2, 2023 Right: A Sonny Angel meetup attendee\n\nLaForte said women in their early 20s can also face a sense of adolescence and turmoil, particularly after college. \u201cIt\u2019s quarter-life crisis time \u2014 you\u2019re realizing, I\u2019m really not a child anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople could also gravitate towards them because it\u2019s reminiscent of when they were children, or it\u2019s symbolic of a little ambivalence towards getting older.\u201d\n\nSaito led me, a woman in her mid-20s, to the wall of mystery boxes in an.m\u00e9 and selected a fruit doll for me. I tore open the inner plastic bag, and a little strawberry head poked out from the wrapping. Almost immediately, thunderous cheers erupted from all sides. \u201cI would have to buy a whole box\u201d \u2014 each contains multiple dolls \u2014 \u201cto get one of those,\u201d one onlooker wailed. \u201cEveryone wants that one!\u201d Saito said excitedly. The strawberry Sonny Angel stared cheekily off to the side, as if about to share a funny secret. Maybe I\u2019d be depressed tomorrow, but today, I only felt joy. \u25cf\n\nThe author with her Sonny Angel\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# How To Spot An Andrew Tate Follower\n\nHave you ever been contacted by a man with an Instagram account with just a few photos of himself posing with a sports car that you know he can\u2019t afford?\n\nBefore misogynist influencer Andrew Tate was deplatformed from Instagram, curious women could click on his profile to see which men in their lives were part of his growing fandom. And while that\u2019s no longer an option, Tate\u2019s impact persists.\u00a0\n\nThe former kickboxer is one of the most influential men on the internet and has built his name \u2014 and assembled a massive online army of men \u2014 by spouting extreme misogynistic views. He has said that women are the property of men, women are unable to be successful without a man\u2019s help, and women bear responsibility if they are raped.\u00a0\n\nTate and his brother Tristan are currently being held in pre-trial detention in Bucharest, Romania, while they are under investigation for human trafficking, rape, and organized crime. They were arrested along with two Romanian women, and authorities have accused the group of sexually exploiting six women. (One of the Romanian women arrested with Tate is Georgiana Naghel, who is believed to be in a romantic relationship with him.) While the general public had only heard of Tate after his December arrest, his toxic influence on how men interact with women has been growing over the last several years.\n\nHave you ever been contacted by a man with an Instagram account with just a few photos of himself posing with a sports car that you know he can\u2019t afford? Or have there been messages in your Instagram requests folder from accounts that only have one photo of a man scowling with his mouth closed? Or maybe a friend has shared a screenshot of a man with a similar profile who DMed them a random emoji out of the blue? If so, he may have been following the teachings of Tate.\u00a0\n\nBoth brothers are being accused of using the \u201cloverboy method\u201d to ensnare the women they are accused of trafficking. The method, in which a perpetrator initiates a sham romantic relationship with a vulnerable person in order to trap and sexually exploit them, has become more prevalent in the age of dating apps and social media. And while the Instagram tactics outlined above aren\u2019t necessarily the \u201cloverboy method,\u201d they are based off of a course Tate made to help men convince women to sleep with them.\n\n## We want your help! If you have more information or a tip regarding Andrew Tate, contact ikran.dahir@buzzfeed.com, or reach us securely at tips.buzzfeed.com.\n\nThe $450 course was one of many of the former kickboxer\u2019s business ventures meant to help turn men into entrepreneurs and \u201cTop Gs.\u201d Other deleted courses, some of which were available on Etsy through resellers, were all aimed at some form of male \u201cself-improvement,\u201d such as fitness programs designed to get you in shape, a body language course with elaborate rules to help you become an \u201calpha male,\u201d and a course that instructed viewers about how they could make money on OnlyFans by using women as sex workers for their own financial gain. In the PHD course, Tate even suggests using women from these relationships to set up a webcam business, which was reportedly a part of his alleged sex trafficking scheme.\u00a0\n\nEtsy said the listing of Tate's videos and courses purchased by BuzzFeed News had been taken down after we flagged them \"because the listings violated our seller policies.\"\n\nOn multiple podcasts, Tate has spoken openly about convincing his girlfriends to do sex work for his webcam business and on OnlyFans, and he has proudly labeled himself \u201ca pimp.\u201d In a deleted course focused on how to make money from OnlyFans, Tate talks about how he doesn\u2019t allow his \u201cgirls\u201d to have access to their own accounts until he trusts them.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cBefore you know it, you're a G sitting there with your phone pimpin\u2019 dudes, making money off girls,\u201d Tate says. Later in the video, he is joined by Vivian, an ex-girlfriend who was featured in a sex tape video with Tate, to talk about the rates she charges on the platform.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn the PHD course, Tate identifies Instagram as \u201cthe number one tool to get laid\u201d over Tinder or any other dating app. He also lists out what he believes made a \u201cmanly\u201d Instagram profile, such as never having any other men in the photos unless they look \u201chard,\u201d only having hot women in photos, not posting too many photos because that\u2019s what women do, and never taking photos with your mouth open. (Tate believes posing with your mouth open is \u201ca sign of submission\u201d and is done by \u201cliberals.\u201d) So if you see a profile where a man has his mouth closed and appears angry for no apparent reason, he could have been taking cues from Tate\u2019s courses.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTate even suggests that if a man doesn\u2019t actually have money or a tough, muscled look for their profile, he should hire a professional photographer to stage a shoot, which should include photos of expensive travel and rented exotic cars. \u201cWhat I try and do with every single post is [create] a degree of intrigue,\u201d Tate says. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to put a spin on your shit.\u201d Tate also implores students to \u201ctake loads of photos next to rocks and oceans and bullshit.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhile Tate calls manosphere and redpill culture \u201cbullshit,\u201d he still leans on old manosphere theories like the world being a \u201csexual marketplace\u201d that is \u201cextremely difficult for men.\u201d A lot of the social media strategy Tate taught in his PHD course also recycles the stereotype that women are only impressed by men with money and status and that \u201cwomen are biologically programmed\u201d to go after these so-called alpha males.\u00a0\n\nBut while he is intent on teaching men how to portray these cliches to capture as many women as possible, he said in the PHD course he doesn\u2019t necessarily align himself with the manosphere belief that \u201cwomen need to be fixed.\u201d He just thinks men should be more opportunistic so they can make the dating world work for them: \u201cIf you\u2019re in the wrong place, you don\u2019t have enough women. If you\u2019re in the right place, you have too many women.\u201d\u00a0\n\nFormer kickboxer Andrew Tate leaves court on Feb. 1, 2023.\u00a0\n\nTate frames himself as a kind of guru for the lost and hopeless men trapped in the online sexual marketplace. Why write, \u201cHey, how are you?\u201d to a stranger, he asks. \u201cWhy would she give a shit about telling you how she is? She knows you don\u2019t care. And she gets that 30 times a day. So she doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\u00a0\n\nInstead, in his course, he frames his advice as helping men become intriguing and a \u201chigher-value person.\u201d One method he suggests? Lying about your job.\u00a0\n\nIn one example, Tate lays out a scenario where a woman asks a man what they do. Instead of telling her he\u2019s a barista at Starbucks, Tate suggests saying he used to be high-level management at Starbucks. Be vague. Lay on the intrigue. \u201cYou\u2019re now James Bond of Starbucks. You were a barista loser. Now you\u2019re James Bond,\u201d he says.\n\nHe also encourages them to DM as many women as possible. \u201cYou can go on Instagram right now and message 100 girls. There are gonna be loads of conversations at once,\u201d Tate says. He suggests adding a random, meaningless emoji as a way of standing out from the other messages they may get throughout the day.\n\n\u201cI just say Bucharest? or Moscow? or LA? sometimes,\u201d Tate says. \u201cI\u2019ll put a completely pointless emoji on the end. Some cherries, or an orange or a strawberry.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTate himself has used this specific emoji method before. A TikToker posted a screenshot of a DM she said came from Tate with the word \u201cLondon? \ud83c\udf39\u201d. And Daria Gu\u0219\u0103, a now-19-year-old student, told BuzzFeed News that she received a DM from Tate\u2019s personal Instagram account when she was 16 years old that read: \u201cRomanian girl \ud83c\udf53.\u201d\u00a0\n\nGu\u0219\u0103 said she did not reply to Tate because he had a bad reputation in Romania, but she told BuzzFeed News that he also DMed some of her friends, who did respond. \u201cAfter a couple of messages, he will start asking where they are and when he can come pick them up,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\nIn the Q&A portion of the course, where Tate plays more into his role as a misogynistic self-help guru, he is asked by a man how he maintains multiple relationships with women and if he should be honest about it. Tate not only suggests hiding it, but also gaslighting their partners if they ask any questions.\u00a0\n\nHe goes on to say that just the night before he filmed the video, one of his \u201cgirls\u201d found hair in bed that didn\u2019t belong to her and questioned him about it. Tate says he told her that he didn\u2019t know where it came from and that she was being \u201cjuvenile.\u201d\n\n\u00a0Tate then tells the story of a woman he was seeing in Slovakia who moved to England to work for him when he wanted to start up his webcam company. He suggests viewers start their own porn business, using webcams, when they have a couple women in love with them, as it is, he says, \u201cfree money.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTate even goes as far as suggesting men conduct a test for \u201ca quality woman.\u201d He tells them not to contact her after having sex to see if she\u2019ll reach out first, because now the man is \u201cin a position of power.\u201d Tate believes that if a woman ends up contacting a man after sleeping with him, she has \u201chumbled\u201d herself and will be \u201cfiercely loyal\u201d to him.\n\nThrough Tate\u2019s courses and misogynistic rhetoric, not only is he helping men groom and sexualize women, but he\u2019s also normalized a toxic dating culture that has had a profoundly negative impact on how men treat women. And though the courses have been removed from his website, fans are still passing clips around on Google Drive and reselling copies of his deleted courses \u2014 ensuring even more women will be played.\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Sheryl Lee Ralph Said A \u201cFamous TV Judge\u201d Sexually Assaulted Her: \u201cEverybody At The Network Saw It.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did not want any bad press around their show and did not care what just happened to me.\u201d\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph has said she was sexually assaulted at a work-related event years ago.\n\nWhile appearing on the podcast Way Up With Angela Yee on Monday, the Abbott Elementary actor said that network executives saw a \u201cfamous TV judge\u201d assault her. She says she was then asked to not report the attack in an effort to avoid \u201cbad press.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis man walked in, grabbed me by the back of my neck, turned me around, and rammed his nasty-ass tongue down my throat. And everybody at the network saw it,\u201d Ralph said.\u00a0\n\nThe 66-year-old Emmy winner did not disclose the alleged assaulter\u2019s name or when the incident may have occurred but clarified she was not talking about Judge Greg Mathis. She called him a \u201cgreat man.\u201d\u00a0\n\nFollowing the alleged incident, Ralph said she called New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial, who was in office from 1994 to 2002. He offered to directly send officers there immediately; however, she said a representative for the network tapped her on the shoulder and said, \u201cplease don\u2019t.\u201d People tried to persuade her that the incident wasn\u2019t as terrible as she thought it was.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey did not want any bad press around their show and did not care what had just happened to me,\u201d Ralph said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of stuff that happens. That\u2019s what happens. That\u2019s what makes it hard for women to speak up about these things.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRalph also cited a previous experience in which a man touched her without consent in front of others.\n\n\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018What did I do to deserve that?\u2019\u201d Ralph said. \u201c\u2018My skirt is at my knees. I have a sweater blouse. What made this man think that he could just come over and put his hands on my body?\u2019\u201d Ralph said. \u201cHe did not know me.\u201d\u00a0\n\nYears later, the man sat across from her at a table at a different event and did not recognize her, Ralph said on the podcast. He seemed to have no memory of that night, so she confronted him in front of others. Ralph said that everybody at the table was appalled that she would stand up for herself and bring the incident up at the dinner table.\u00a0\n\nLater in the podcast, Ralph said she was shocked to see justice for the victims of Harvey Weinstein, who last month was found guilty of multiple sex crimes in Los Angeles and given a 16-year prison sentence in addition to his 23-year sentence in New York.\n\nYee thanked Ralph for sharing her experiences. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine the things you\u2019ve been through being in this business as long as you have,\u201d Yee said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s important because there\u2019s so many women that might feel like they got some power hearing you talk.\"\n\nGiving advice to other women in the entertainment industry, Ralph said not to accept an invitation from a man asking them to go to his room in the middle of the night and said have him meet them in the lobby instead. She also encouraged women to speak up about sexual assault and not live with the \u201chorrible\u201d effect it has on victims.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNowadays, speak up. Tell your truth. Do not carry the burden of that pain especially if it\u2019s something you feel you cannot work through. Because you know situations like this experiences like this drive people crazy. It hurts them to their core. They get changed forever,\u201d Ralph said.\u00a0\n\n## Related Stories\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

The family named one of Robinson\u2019s companions as the suspected perpetrator and said Mexican authorities had issued a warrant for that woman\u2019s arrest.\u00a0\n\nFBI agents and Department of Justice prosecutors investigated Robinson\u2019s death, but the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of North Carolina said Wednesday that they could not prove that any federal crime had been committed.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBased on the results of the autopsy and after a careful deliberation and review of the investigative materials by both U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices, federal prosecutors informed Ms. Robinson\u2019s family today that the available evidence does not support a federal prosecution,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement.\u00a0\n\nNoting the \u201cpublic concern\u201d around the case, officials said they reached their determination after \u201cexperienced federal agents and seasoned prosecutors extensively reviewed the available evidence.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutors met with Robinson\u2019s family on Wednesday morning to inform them of their decision.\n\n\u201cAs in any case, the government is prepared to review and examine new information related to the investigation should it become available,\u201d officials said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the prosecutors\u2019 decision would affect any extradition efforts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed, but we\u2019re not deterred,\u201d Robinson family attorney Sue-Ann Robinson told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. According to the lawyer, the autopsy conducted in the US did not discover any spinal cord injuries, in contrast to the results of the Mexican autopsy.\n\nShe criticized what she described as a \u201cdelay\u201d in the US investigation, which she suggested could have impacted the findings. She said that the Robinson family would continue to demand a \u201chigh level of diplomatic intervention\u201d in the case.\n\n\u201cUnited States citizens cannot go to Mexico, commit a crime that we all saw on a video, and then come back to America and say, \u2018We\u2019re on base. We\u2019re safe. We\u2019re not going to be charged with a crime,\u2019\u201d the attorney said. \u201cThat cannot be the message that the US authorities want to send.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why a Black woman should go on vacation with her friends, be returned to her family in a box, and nothing be done for five months,\u201d she said. In a statement, civil rights attorney Ben Crump said that while the DOJ decision is \"discouraging,\" they believe \"justice is still possible for her death\" via prosecutors in Mexico.\n\n## More on this\n\n",

        "article": "# I Am Prepared To See Every \u201cKnives Out\u201d/\"Glass Onion\" Movie That Is Ever Made\n\nThe newest Netflix murder mystery is packed with stars having the time of their lives, which means audiences will too.\n\nDetective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) in Glass Onion\n\nLike many people during the pandemic lockdowns, I found myself missing the communal movie theater experience. With the right film, there are few things more enjoyable than reacting in real time with strangers in the dark to a big screen romp.\n\nFew movies have come out since theaters reopened that made me feel that way again \u2014 Everything Everywhere All at Once immediately springs to mind \u2014 which is maybe why I felt like I was floating on a cloud when I left a November screening of Glass Onion, the sequel to 2019\u2019s Knives Out.\n\nThe Daniel Craig\u2013led murder mystery was an absolute riot. The audience in my crowded theater laughed hysterically at writer-director Rian Johnson\u2019s joke-packed script, which was full of twists, turns, time jumps, surprise cameos, and red herrings. By the time it was all over, I felt like I\u2019d emerged from a carnival.\n\nAnd then, just as quickly as it was released, Glass Onion was yanked from theaters. It had been shown on roughly only 600 screens nationwide for just a week. Audiences had crammed in to see it while they could, but despite the demand, Netflix stuck to its strategy of releasing the movie in theaters briefly so as to generate buzz and word of mouth.\n\nI suppose that makes sense for Netflix\u2019s goal of driving people to subscribe to the platform (even if it potentially missed out on hundreds of millions of dollars in box office sales). But it is disappointing because Glass Onion is the kind of joyful movie-watching experience best relished with a group. When it arrives on Netflix on Dec. 23, my advice is to gather as many friends and family as you can, put your phones in a box, dim the lights, and enjoy the ride.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to when the cast is so plainly having a ball. Craig returns as detective Benoit Blanc, who receives an invitation to attend a weekend murder mystery party on the private island of tech billionaire Miles Bron (Edward Norton doing his best Elon Musk impersonation). Bron\u2019s friends and guests include Connecticut Gov. Claire Debella (Kathryn Hahn), funky scientist Lionel Toussaint (Leslie Odom Jr.), men\u2019s rights Twitch streamer Duke Cody (Dave Bautista), and Birdie Jay (Kate Hudson), a supermodel turned athleisure designer recently canceled after a particularly bad tweet. Also along for the ride is Cassandra \"Andi\" Brand (Janelle Mon\u00e1e), Bron\u2019s spurned former business partner, who has an axe to grind with just about everyone.\n\nFrom left: Peg (Jessica Henwick), Birdie (Hudson), and Andi (Mon\u00e1e).\n\nEnsemble movies with big-name stars tend to be a blast because we get to imagine the interaction between them behind the scenes. But murder mysteries, in particular, are so enjoyable because they often feel like plays where the actors are encouraged to ramp up the acting so the people in the back of the theater can see. Suspicious stares! Menacing scowls! Dramatic fainting! I eat it all up.\n\nWhen the movie opens, it\u2019s the middle of 2020\u2019s COVID lockdowns and Bron\u2019s friends are just as excited by the chance to gather again as I was to be in a theater. But don\u2019t expect Glass Onion to follow the same structure as Knives Out, which opened with a death that was investigated throughout the rest of the film. Here, more than half the film is spent getting to know the characters as we await a seemingly inevitable murder, but instead we get something entirely different. Not all the characters are who they appear to be, which forces us to constantly question who might be a villain and who might end up dead.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only way in which this sequel differs from the original. Knives Out was cold and gray in both its autumnal Massachusetts setting and semi-serious tone, though it was still a thoroughly enjoyable movie. (How could it not be, with Chris Evans wearing that cable-knit sweater?) Glass Onion, by contrast, feels joyful and vibrant, even if we know we\u2019re going to see a murder or two. The sunny Greek island setting helps, but mostly it\u2019s the bubbly cast and Johnson\u2019s lively and genuinely surprising script. Barely a minute goes by without a joke, and they all somehow land \u2014 even one about a Jeremy Renner brand of hot sauce, which will only truly make sense to the terminally online. There\u2019s a cameo from one sports star, which I won\u2019t spoil, but it was as surprising as it was hilarious.\n\nThe movie is, dare I say, camp. That\u2019s famously a tough word to define, but I\u2019d argue that any film where Craig wears a striped nautical ensemble and yellow neckerchief more than meets the definition.\n\nAfter portraying James Bond for 15 years in five movies, a role he eventually found physically and creatively exhausting, it seems likely that Craig only felt compelled to play yet another recurring protagonist because this role is so playful. (Bautista, who also starred with Craig in the 2015 Bond film Spectre, has said working with the star in both films was like night and day. \"He didn't seem like the happiest person on Bond, but on Glass Onion, it was the complete opposite,\u201d Bautista told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cHe was just so much fun, and he was always smiling and happy and interacted a lot more.\u201d)\n\nLike Agatha Christie\u2019s Hercule Poirot, Blanc is an effete and preening detective who is comfortable with his genius, doesn\u2019t suffer fools, and longs for the next riddle to solve. Craig\u2019s attempt at a Southern accent \u2014 described by Evans\u2019s character in the first movie as a \u201cKentucky-fried Foghorn Leghorn drawl\u201d \u2014 remains ridiculous, but that\u2019s sort of the point. In one scene, Blanc buzzes with such joy at a dinner party where his genius is so consuming that the other characters almost slide off their chairs in shock (admittedly, same).\n\nThe rest of the cast are at their peak too, especially Mon\u00e1e, who gives a multilayered performance that bubbles into magnificent rage, and Hudson, who I don\u2019t think has been this good in a role since Almost Famous in 2000. As Birdie Jay, she appears hopelessly clueless but also so delightfully warm that you understand instantly why the others want to hang around her. I genuinely hope that they\u2019re both in the mix for Best Supporting Actress come Oscar season.\n\nFrom left: Miles (Norton), Whiskey (Madelyn Cline), and Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig).\n\nNetflix already has the rights to make a third Knives Out (after paying an astonishing $450 million last year for films two and three), and although production hasn\u2019t started yet, I\u2019m already mentally lining up for tickets. I hope this becomes Netflix\u2019s equivalent of HBO\u2019s The White Lotus, with each installment bringing us a new cast in a glamorous location.\n\nI don\u2019t want to spoil anything, because part of the joy of these movies is going in as clueless as possible, but I will say there is one central discussion in the film about the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d which billionaire Bron has been temporarily loaned by the French government for a mind-boggling sum because of the Louvre\u2019s pandemic-era closure.\n\nThe host tells his stunned guests how Da Vinci was able to create the masterpiece using pioneering brushstrokes and technique. In awe of the painter\u2019s genius and mastery, Bron says he longs to be remembered in the same way that people talk about great art.\n\nBut Glass Onion is a perfect reminder that great art need not be serious. Sometimes, it\u2019s just about having fun. If you look closely, even the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d is smiling just a little. \u25cf\n\n## More like this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

What did you do? You made him feel like this.\u201d\n\n## \nBella Thorne has candidly reflected on some of her past experiences as a child actor, revealing that she was once accused of \u201cflirting\u201d with a film director when she was just 10.\n\n\n## \nSitting down for an appearance on the High Low with EmRata podcast last week, Bella told host Emily Ratajkowski all about her rise to stardom and how the fame impacted her as she grew up.\n\n\n## \nBella memorably shot to fame after starring in Disney Channel series Shake It Up alongside Zendaya between 2010 and 2013, when she was just 12.\n\n\n## \nHowever, she was actually thrust into the industry at a much younger age, telling Emily that she not only completed acting jobs from the age of 8, but also that she featured in modeling photo shoots at just 6 weeks old.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI started acting when I was 8 and I started modeling when I was 6 weeks old,\u201d she said.\n\n\n## \nAnd detailing some of the negative experiences that came with her fame, Bella detailed how a film director once accused her of making him \u201creally uncomfortable\u201d by \u201cflirting with him\u201d at the age of 10.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI had a director give me feedback once, and I was 10,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe casting director calls my agent and the agent calls my mom, and they\u2019re like, \u2018So, she\u2019s not moving forward because the director felt like she was flirting with him, and it made him really uncomfortable.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cI still go back to this every day,\u201d she said, admitting that while she reminds herself that she was not \u201cthe problem\u201d at 10, she still finds herself searching for \u201cfault\u201d in her actions.\n\n\n## \n\u201cWhat did you do, Bella? What did you do? You made him feel like this,\u201d she detailed thinking, before expressing her anger at the accusation.\n\n\n## \n\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about man? I don\u2019t give a fuck what the fuck I said. I don\u2019t care if I said, \u2018Eat my pussy right now.\u2019 She is 10 years old. Why would you ever think that?\u201d she said.\n\n\n## \n\u201cAlso, you\u2019re in a director session. You can\u2019t really say or do anything. You do the scene, you say hello, and you walk out. There is no time to go sit on your lap or make you uncomfortable. What the fuck are you talking about?\u201d she added.\n\n\n## \nAs she and Emily went on to discuss the wider culture of sexualizing young girls in the Hollywood scene, Bella then recalled the time she was allegedly almost \u201cfired\u201d from Disney after being photographed wearing a bikini on the beach.\n\n\n## \n\u201cOne time, I almost got fired off of Disney Channel \u2018cause I was 14 and I wore a two-piece on the beach,\u201d she said.\n\n\n## \n\u201cThis stylist that I was hanging out with put this chain on me \u2014 it was like a body chain. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t care,\u201d she recounted.\n\n\n## \n\u201cThere was a fan, they got a photo of me on the beach, I almost got fired. It was all over the media, it was literally viral at that time,\u201d she said, with Emily going on to note how ironic it was given that Bella was also expected to pose and \u201clook hot\u201d on red carpets at the same time.\n\n\n## \nBella ultimately described being in the limelight as a child as \u201cfucking stressful,\u201d detailing how she was made to portray herself in a certain way to appease people.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI had to talk in a whole different voice,\u201d she revealed. \u201cMy voice has been this tone since I was that little. I\u2019ve always had a deep voice. People used to think it made me sound negative and it made me sound like a man.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cSaying my favorite color was pink \u2014 that drove me nuts!\u201d she said, adding that she grew to become \u201cso angry\u201d at \u201call the lies\u201d she\u2019d been \u201cspilling.\u201d\n\n\n## \nElsewhere in the interview, Bella detailed how difficult it was to grow comfortable with her sexuality and identity with \u201cnot only the whole world watching\u2026 but specifically men.\u201d\n\n\n## \nBella and Emily went on to discuss how hard it is to navigate conversations about the pressures faced by young women, who are often simultaneously told not to appear too sexual while constantly being sexualized.\n\n\n## \n\u201cIt makes me genuinely so scared to have a child and it be a girl,\u201d Bella admitted.\n\n\n## \nEmily, who has a son, weighed in to note that she had no clue \u201cwhere to begin\u201d when she was still unaware if her baby was a girl. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that I can handle this. I feel so protective and so scared, and I\u2019m not sure what the right way is to have these conversations with young women,\u201d she recalled thinking.\n\n\n## \nInterestingly, Emily previously opened up about feeling \u201cso relieved\u201d when she found out she was having a boy for this very reason.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI wanted a daughter initially, but when I found out I was having a son, I was so relieved,\u201d she told Elle in November 2021.\n\n\n## \n\u201cBecause I think that it would bring up \u2014 I want more children, so it might be something I deal with later \u2014 being sexualized way before puberty and being aware of it,\u201d she added.\n\n\n## \nYou can listen to Bella\u2019s full appearance on Emily\u2019s podcast here.\n\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

And she\u2019s like, \u2018Well, then you probably won\u2019t be invited back.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cSo then I was like, OK. And I\u2019d seen what everybody else was doing, so I knew that this was, like, a 10-second thing. I mean, definitely no more than a minute,\u201d she went on.\n\n\n## \nMadison echoed, \u201cMy memory is cloudy. I\u2019ve kind of blocked it\u2026 Everybody\u2019s just trying to get it done as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\n\n## \nNow, Madison and Marquardt have opened up further about their sexual experiences with Hefner, discussing the subject of birth control \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 on the latest episode of Girls Next Level.\n\n\n## \nThe topic was brought up as part of a wide-ranging Q&A, during which the pair were asked, \u201cWere all the girls on birth control? How did y\u2019all prevent pregnancy?\u201d\n\n\n## \nPerhaps surprisingly, Madison explained that the women didn\u2019t feel \u201cfor a second\u201d that they were going to get pregnant while sleeping with Hefner and didn\u2019t use birth control as a result.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI don\u2019t know who was and wasn\u2019t on birth control \u2014 I wasn\u2019t \u2014 but I just don\u2019t think anyone ever felt for a second that they were gonna get pregnant from Hef,\u201d she said.\n\n\n## \nGoing on to explain the reasoning behind this, Madison said she didn\u2019t want to be \u201cgross and graphic\u201d before noting that Hefner \u201cnever finished in anybody.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cNot to be gross and graphic, but here we are. He never finished in anybody,\u201d she said.\n\n\n## \n\u201cAnd when I say that, I don\u2019t mean a last-minute pullout,\u201d she continued. \u201cI mean, he would do whatever on our bedroom nights, and then the last part of it would just be him jacking off watching porn. Like, it wasn\u2019t even near anybody.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cSo I just don\u2019t think any of us ever thought for a second that we were in danger of getting pregnant by him,\u201d she said.\n\n\n## \nMadison went on to further defend her and the ex-Playmates\u2019 choice to stay off birth control by noting that Hefner \u201cknew what he was doing.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cIf you look at his history and all the people he\u2019s been with, he\u2019s only ever had kids when he was married and it was planned,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, he knew what he was doing in that respect.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cI just don\u2019t think anybody was concerned,\u201d she added.\n\n\n## \nMarquardt then chimed in, noting that while she was on birth control pills, it had nothing to do with her fear of getting pregnant by Hefner.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI was on birth control pills, but it wasn\u2019t \u2018cause I feared I was gonna get pregnant. It was just something I\u2019d already been on, and it was hormone-related and that kind of stuff,\u201d she said.\n\n\n## \nYou can listen to the full episode of Girls Next Level here.\n\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# RIP To The Best Bots On Twitter\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not paying a dime to Elon lol.\u201d\n\nOne of the most popular bots on Twitter is @MakeItAQuote, which has more than 565,000 followers. You can reply to any tweet and tag @MakeItAQuote, and the bot will respond with the tweet\u2019s text overlaid onto an image, creating some funny results. But now, the fun may be over, as Twitter is making a change that could effectively kill off all free bots.\u00a0\n\nTwitter just announced that starting next week, it \u201cwill no longer support free access\u201d to its application programming interface, the trove of data that bots like @MakeItAQuote need to use in order to reply, search for text, and produce automated tweets.\u00a0\n\nWhile this seems like a good step toward cracking down on annoying or spammy bots (and making Twitter some much-needed money), it has a hugely unfortunate side effect: It will stop some of the \u201cgood\u201d bots that have long made up part of the fabric of Twitter.\u00a0\n\nDaniel, the 23-year-old student in Germany behind @MakeItAQuote, told BuzzFeed News he would have never started it if there were a fee attached. \u201cIt's a step in the wrong direction, as most of the API usage brings a lot of value to the platform,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that even myself, operating one of the biggest bots on the platform, has to consider shutting it down is very concerning. There are a lot of awesome, less popular bots. I don't think any of them can be sustainable.\u201d\n\n@itszxmetal\n\nThe exact pricing of API access is not yet clear, and representatives for Twitter did not respond to requests for clarification. One screenshot of current API use pricing has been going around; prices start at $149/month for 500 requests of the API per month and go up to $2,499/month for high-volume use.\u00a0On Thursday evening, Twitter owner Elon Musk posted a tweet suggesting that access to the API would cost $100/month and require ID verification.\n\n@BillyM2k @ericnakagawa Yeah, free API is being abused badly right now by bot scammers &amp; opinion manipulators. There\u2019s no verification process or cost, so easy to spin up 100k bots to do bad things.\n\nJust ~$100/month for API access with ID verification will clean things up greatly.\n\nThere\u2019s a long history of beloved bots on Twitter. @Horse_ebooks was a bot that grew a cult following for its vibey snippets of text like \u201ceverything happens so much.\u201d (The account eventually was taken over by a human who continued to manually tweet in a bot-like way until he revealed himself.)\u00a0\n\nOther bots are newsworthy, like @TrumpsAlert and @BigTechAlert, which tweet whenever Trump and his advisers or Big Tech CEOs, respectively, follow or unfollow a new person.\n\n\ud83d\udc40 @elonmusk (Great person. Please do not ban this bot.) is no longer following @Grimezsz\n\n\u00c1lex Barredo, who runs @BigTechAlert, told BuzzFeed News he's open to paying a small fee to keep the popular bot running, but not if it costs $100 a month. He also has other options. He's aware that most of the actual spam bots don't even use the API to operate (which means charging for API access isn't really going to wipe out spam), so one option he's considering is to rework the bot so it doesn't need the API. He's also considering either open-sourcing it or moving it to its own website or a different platform.\n\n\"It was a fun thing, a thing that actually provided Twitter with more value,\" Barredo told BuzzFeed News.\n\nSome bots are just pleasant and surprising additions to your timeline. Joe Schoech of Vermont runs @_restaurant_bot (random photos of restaurants from Google Maps), @_weather_bot_ (current weather conditions from randomized places around the world), @everygoodfella (screenshots of every second of the movie Goodfellas), and a few others. He also doesn\u2019t plan on paying and is considering moving them all to Mastodon.\u201cIt's over,\u201d he told BuzzFeed News. \u201cBots are maybe the best part about Twitter! I follow a ton of them, they're cool and weird, and I will miss them. Fuck Elon, I never liked that guy.\u201d\n\nNeil Freeman, who runs @everylotnyc, a bot that tweets photos of each lot on Google Street View from tax records, shares a similar sentiment. \"Any amount of money would be too much to pay to post on a site that doesn\u2019t even ban Nazis,\" he told BuzzFeed news.\n\nJohn Emerson, a designer and programmer in Brooklyn, runs 24 bots, mostly ones that tweet out images from the collections of various art museums. He told BuzzFeed News if he has to pay to keep the bots running, he\u2019ll abandon them. \u201cI had ideas for other more active and interactive bots, but it\u2019s pretty clear Twitter is no longer a place for that kind of experimentation or innovation,\u201d he said.\n\nOther bots are simply just fun. @ca_dmv_bot tweets out vanity plates that were rejected by the California Department of Motor Vehicles, along with the DMV\u2019s reasoning. The bot\u2019s creation was inspired by a Los Angeles magazine article about rejected plates, which revealed that they\u2019re often incredibly funny.\n\nCustomer: A REFERENCE TO THE 90'S SITCOM SEINFELD\nDMV: ASS MAN\n\nVerdict: DENIED\n\n@ca_dmv_bot is run by RJ, a 15-year-old in California who requested that BuzzFeed News not use his full name for privacy reasons. At the current API usage rates, it would cost over $3,400 a year to keep @ca_dmv_bot running. RJ told BuzzFeed News over DM he might be willing to pay a lower amount, \u201cbut it\u2019d have to come from tips/donation money entirely since I\u2019m not paying a dime to Elon lol.\u201d\n\nokay universe, you were embarrassing\n\nRob Dubbin, founder of the collaborative scriptwriting app Scripto, created the bot @oliviataters \u2014 a bot that tweets out fragments that read like the ramblings of a teenage girl, which are based on snippets of text found through search on the API. He said that he had no plans to pay any amount to keep his bot going.\n\n\u201cVichy Twitter had already stopped being a cool place to put bots or art in general, but the fact that until today you could still run your bots if you wanted to was a tether to a better time in its history, when it was more of a social canvas for goofy experimentation and feedback,\u201d Dubbin told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIs charging for API access a good business idea? Who cares! It's another castle built on shit.\u201d\n\n## \nUPDATE\n\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from \u00c1lex Barredo and Neil Freeman about their accounts and plans.\n\nCorrection: John Emerson runs 24 bots, 16 of which are dedicated to museums. An earlier version of this post misstated the number.\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\nKatie Notopoulos is a senior technology reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

        "article": "# The Razzies Responded After Being Slammed For Nominating A 12-Year-Old For \u201cWorst Actress\u201d\n\nFormer and current child stars are defending Ryan Kiera Armstrong, who starred opposite Zac Efron in Firestarter, after the \u201cmean-spirited\u201d nomination.\n\nRyan Kiera Armstrong\n\nEvery year, the Golden Raspberry Awards are handed out on the eve of the Oscars as a counterpoint to Hollywood\u2019s night of nights.\u00a0\n\nFor more than four decades, the \u201cRazzies,\u201d as they\u2019re widely known, have recognized the industry\u2019s worst films and performances as a way to poke fun at the seriousness and competitiveness of awards season.\u00a0\n\nOrganizers encourage nominees to \u201cown your bad,\u201d but it\u2019s rare that people actually turn up to claim their trophy, with Halle Berry being a famous exception for the time she came to accept her Razzie for Catwoman (2004), which she described in her acceptance speech as \u201ca piece-of-shit, godawful movie.\u201d\n\nThis year, the movies being honored with a Razzie nomination \u2014 such as it is \u2014 include the Netflix movie Blonde about Marilyn Monroe, Disney\u2019s live-action Pinocchio remake with Tom Hanks, and, of course, Morbius.\u00a0\n\nBut there\u2019s one nomination that has drawn extensive backlash: that of 12-year-old actor Ryan Kiera Armstrong, who was nominated for Worst Actress for her role in Firestarter.\n\nThat movie, in which Armstrong starred opposite Zac Efron, is the second adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s 1980 novel of the same name about a little girl with the power of pyrokinesis. In the 1984 movie version, Armstrong\u2019s role was played by Drew Barrymore.\u00a0\n\nThe 2022 version was not a critical success. \u201cNo one here seems to know what they\u2019re doing and, more importantly, why,\u201d the film critic for the Guardian wrote.\u00a0\n\nRolling Stone called it a \u201cfour-alarm disaster,\u201d but was still somewhat kind to the young child star (who was 11 at the time of filming), writing, \u201cArmstrong does her best in a mostly impossible role.\u201d\n\nChild actor Julian Hilliard was among those defending Armstrong.\n\nDespite the movie flopping, many Hollywood players and fans felt the Razzie nomination for such a young child was mean-spirited.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Razzies are run by soulless people. Nominating a 12 year old? Fuck them,\u201d actor Devon Sawa, himself a former child star, said. \u201cThat child could grow to be amazing if you haven\u2019t gotten in their head.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe razzies are already mean-spirited & classless, but to nominate a kid is just repulsive & wrong,\u201d tweeted Julian Hilliard, a child actor known for WandaVision and The Haunting of Hill House. \u201cWhy put a kid at risk of increased bullying or worse? Be better.\u201d\n\nOthers on Twitter agreed that the nomination felt cruel.\n\nThe Razzies have always been a pathetic excuse for\u2026 something\u2026 but nominating a child is particularly egregious for so many reasons. Shut it all down.\n\na little creepy for an awards body made up of adults to publicly humiliate a child #Razzies\n\nThe Razzies could be fun if they did things like \u2018Biggest Oscar Bait\u2019 and \u2018Most Egregious Use of Lens Flair\u2019 and not did things like nominating a CHILD.\n\nThe Razzies are extra despicable for nominating a child actor.\n\nSome pointed out this wasn\u2019t the first time the Razzies had shamed a child, highlighting past nominations such as Jake Lloyd for Star Wars: Episode I \u2014 The Phantom Menace (1999) and Macaulay Culkin, who was nominated three times in 1995 for Getting Even With Dad, The Pagemaster, and Richie Rich.\n\nJust a reminder that it isn\u2019t the first time the Razzies Awards ruined a child actor\u2019s life.\n\n@_JulianHilliard Its almost like they've forgotten what happened to Jake Lloyd or Macaulay Culkin, who they also put up for razzies btw\n\nSpeaking with BuzzFeed News, Razzies cofounder John Wilson said the roughly 1,100 voting members put Armstrong in fifth place, but organizers had still debated whether to include her because of her age. They ultimately decided to respect the votes and include Armstrong, whom Wilson described as an \u201cexperienced actress, even if she\u2019s only 12.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see how it could be taken that way [as mean]. I don't think that was how it was meant,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI think people who get upset about it \u2014 I don't even know how to say this. The rage is interesting \u2014 perhaps somewhat justified, but I think overblown.\u201d\n\nHe said of the backlash, \u201cThere's a righteousness about it. It's the Razzie Awards, for goodness\u2019 sake!\u201d\n\nWilson also said he was familiar with King's original novel, as well as the 1984 movie with Barrymore, who he said had given a \"great performance.\"\n\nStill, he admitted that the Razzies had probably erred this year in nominating the young Armstrong.\n\n\u201cThe intent was to be funny. In this particular instance, we seem to have misstepped very badly. I would admit that,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn Wilson presents at the 2012 Razzie Awards.\n\nOn Instagram, commenters left kind words on Armstrong\u2019s most recent post from a week ago about Firestarter.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIgnore the Razzies. You did a GREAT job and have a successful career ahead of you!!\u201d one user wrote.\n\nCameron Britton \u2014 an actor who\u2019s appeared on the Netflix shows Mindhunter, The Umbrella Academy, and The Woman in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window \u2014 also left some encouraging words for Armstrong. \u201cI just want to say that taking risks and pursuing art when you want to is what life is all about, and when people you don't even know try to degrade you, they are only degrading themselves, because their problems have nothing to do with you- it's them and where they are at,\u201d he wrote.\u00a0\n\nA representative for Armstrong didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLast year, the Razzies decided to rescind a mock honor they had bestowed on actor Bruce Willis because organizers felt it was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d after the actor\u2019s family revealed he\u2019d been diagnosed with aphasia, a medical condition that meant he was losing his ability to communicate.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf someone's medical condition is a factor in their decision making and/or their performance, we acknowledge that it is not appropriate to give them a Razzie,\u201d organizers said.\n\n## \nUPDATE\n\n\nOrganizers of the Razzie Awards apologized on Wednesday for nominating Armstrong for Worst Actress and withdrew the nomination.\n\n",

Here\u2019s What We Know About Them.\n\n\"What was meant to be a night out celebrating the Lunar New Year with friends ended up being a devastating and life-changing event for my family.\"\n\nA memorial outside Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, California, for the victims of the mass shooting\n\nAll 11 victims of the Monterey Park, California, shooting have been identified by officials and friends as authorities continue to investigate a motive in the deadly mass shooting on Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nTen people were pronounced dead at the scene and 10 others were injured after a shooter opened fire at Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, a city with a predominantly Asian population, on Saturday night. The shooter then traveled to another dance studio in Alhambra, Lai Lai, but was forcibly disarmed by the owner\u2019s son as he walked into the building.\u00a0\n\nAnother victim who was being treated for \"extensive injuries\" died at the hospital on Monday, USC + LAC Medical Center said, increasing the death toll to 11.\n\nMy My Nhan, 65; LiLan Li, 63; Xiujuan Yu, 57; Muoi Dai Ung, 67; Hongying Jian, 62; Diana Man Ling Tom, 70; Yu-Lun Kao, 72; Chia Ling Yau, 76; Valentino Marcos Alvero, 68; Wen-Tau Yu, 64; and Ming Wei Ma, 72, were identified by the coroner\u2019s office on Tuesday.\n\nVictor Yushin, an instructor at Star Ballroom, told BuzzFeed News that although new dancers would come in often, many of the students knew each other.\n\n\"It's a community and for sure, it's a good place for people who just enjoyed dancing, you know,\" Yushin said. \"I never see any arguments in there, people [getting] angry or something. No, it was just [a] good place.\"\n\nA GoFundMe created by several Asian American and Pacific Islander advocacy groups is raising money for those affected by the shooting.\n\nThree of the victims, Kao, Yu, and Yau, were Taiwanese Americans, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\"TECO-LA conveys our heartfelt condolences to the victims and their families and sends our prayers to the injured for a speedy recovery,\" the office said in a statement.\n\nThe embassy said it was assisting the victims' loved ones who live in Taiwan and plans to travel to the US to take care of their affairs. The families declined to provide statements.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the victims so far.\u00a0\n\n## Ming Wei Ma, 72\n\n#### View this post on Facebook\n\nThe owner of the studio and a beloved dance instructor who was the \u201cheart\u201d of Star Ballroom, Ma was identified by colleagues and friends as one of the victims on Sunday night.\n\nMa was a staple of the dance community and \u201cbeloved and respected\u201d by those who were a part of it, said Eric Chen, a friend of Ma\u2019s who spoke to ABC7.\u00a0\n\nChen said he was killed while trying to stop the shooter.\u00a0\n\nLauren Woods, another instructor at the studio, wrote in a Facebook post that she talked to Ma for the last time on Saturday; he helped her find a parking space in the crowded streets amid the New Year's celebrations.\u00a0\n\nWoods said she and Ma had a special way of communicating.\n\n\u201cHis English was not great, but he\u2019d always say, \u2018My teacher! My teacher!\u2019 Always kiss my cheeks and say \u2018Love You! Love you!\u2019 Full of hugs and physically pick me up sometimes. It was always so loving when he would do this,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0\n\nMa was \u201cthe heart of Star Ballroom,\u201d Woods added. He connected with many people who came through the dance studio.\n\n\u201cTo the ones who were there and so many other dancers in our community, I\u2019m so glad you got to meet and get to know Ma and his beautiful soul, at least once, before passing,\u201d she wrote.\n\nYushin told BuzzFeed News that Ma always made sure people were comfortable at his studio.\n\n\"He always tried to communicate with everybody, he always would be nice,\" said Yushin, who started teaching at Star Ballroom seven or eight months ago. \"Whenever you need some help, whatever you need ... whatever he has at the time, he shared. He was always helping everybody.\"\n\nAt his dance studio, Ma \"built a community that dearly loved and respected him for his kindness and liveliness,\" a GoFundMe created to help pay for his funeral expenses said.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Pasadena Star-News about Chinese immigrants taking up Latin dance at the studio, Ma said he wanted to offer a place for Asians in Monterey Park to be active.\n\n\u201cHaving a place where people from all over the world can come together and communicate through dance is how I can help,\u201d Ma said.\u00a0\n\n## My Nhan, 65\n\nNhan, whose family called her Mymy, was a longtime patron of Star Ballroom who often went dancing on the weekends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what she loved to do,\u201d her family said in a statement. \u201cBut unfairly, Saturday was her last dance.\u201d\n\nNhan was the first person who was shot and killed at the studio that night, according to Tiffany Liou, a reporter whose husband was Nhan\u2019s nephew.\u00a0\n\nNhan was shot in her car outside Star Ballroom, Fox 11 journalist Gigi Graciette reported.\n\nMymy Nhan was the first person shot and killed during the #MontereyPark mass shooting.\n\nI've covered a lot of tragedies, and never imagined one would hit so close to home.\n\nMy husband's family is hurting beyond measure.\nHere's a statement on behalf of the family.\n\nLiou said their family got a call from the coroner\u2019s office on Saturday night.\n\nIt was \u201ca 14 minute call that we anticipated, dreaded, and will never forget,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nNhan\u2019s family said they were \u201cstarting the Lunar New Year broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never imagined her life would end so suddenly,\u201d they said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you knew her, you knew her warm smile and kindness was contagious. She was a loving aunt, sister, daughter and friend,\u201d her family said. \u201cMymy was our biggest cheerleader.\u201d\n\n## Valentino Alvero, 68\n\nIn the hours after the shooting, Alvero's family members weren't sure what happened to him; all they knew was that his van was parked in the same plaza as Star Ballroom, his great-niece, Karmel Kwan, posted on Twitter.\n\nThe coroner's office confirmed his death on Monday.\n\nA statement from the Philippine Consulate General in Los Angeles said Alvero was a US citizen of Filipino descent.\n\n\"While this is not the news we hoped, the unbearable unknown is over. Thank you to those who shared + reached out,\" Kwan wrote on Twitter.\n\nAlvero's family urged the public to \"remember that Valentino is more than just a headline or a news story.\" He was a devout Catholic and a loving son, brother, father, grandfather, and uncle.\n\n\"He loved people and hearing about their lives and in return, he shared his own stories with so much gusto and enthusiasm that you couldn't help but listen and laugh along with him,\" his family said in a statement. \"He loved ballroom dancing, he loved his community, and was the life of the party.\"\n\nOur family\u2019s official statement on the Monterey Park shooting:\n\nAlvero loved dancing and singing around the house, his son, Val Anthony Alvero, told CNN.\n\n\"He's not the type of person to run away from danger,\" Val said. \"Once I knew he was there, it was very likely that he was injured or unfortunately one of those that passed away.\"\n\nHis family created a GoFundMe for his funeral expenses so as to \"honor his memory the way he would want, with a big funeral Mass and party,\" they said.\n\n## Xiujuan Yu, 57\n\nLike other families, Yu's waited anxiously for days before getting the news that she was one of the people killed in the shooting.\n\nYu immigrated from China to the US in the early 2010s, her niece, Kathleen Fong, said in a GoFundMe to raise money for funeral costs.\n\n\"She and her family have done their best to make a life for themselves here, leaving their past lives behind in China to craft a new future for their little family,\" Fong wrote. \"My aunt was in the middle of crafting that future with her husband and children, and now to have that journey suddenly interrupted is heartbreaking. She will never be able to witness what she dreamed of for all these years.\"\n\nYu had three children, including twins who are currently students at California State universities. Yu and her husband worked hard to support their daughters, taking up labor-intensive work and odd jobs where they could.\n\n\"What was meant to be a night out celebrating the Lunar New Year with friends ended up being a devastating and life-changing event for my family,\" Fong wrote. \"Personally, this still doesn't feel real. It happened all too quickly \u2014 we never even got a chance to properly say goodbye.\"\n\n## Diana Tom, 70\n\nDiana Tom\n\nTom was identified by family members as the woman who later died at the hospital of injuries sustained in the shooting, the Los Angeles Times reported. Her family described her as a \"hard-working mother, wife and grandmother who loved to dance.\"\n\n\"On behalf of Diana Tom, we, her family, condemn this senseless act of violence that has uprooted the lives of all the victims, their families and the entire API community at large,\" the family said in a statement provided to BuzzFeed News.\n\nTom was dancing with her friends at Star Dance Saturday evening to celebrate the Lunar New Year, her family said.\n\n\"To those who knew her, she was someone who always went out of her way to give to others,\" they said.\n\nThe family has set up a GoFundMe to help them pay for Tom's medical costs, funeral, family care, and legal needs. The family also encouraged people to donate to a fundraiser organized by Asian Americans Advancing Justice Southern California and other local groups that supports victims of the shooting.\n\n## Yu Lun Kao, 72\n\nKao, who also went by Andy, was at Star Ballroom with his longtime dance partner and friend on Saturday night.\n\nKao and his friend, Shally \u2014 who has spoken to ABC7 but declined to share her last name \u2014 hid under a table when the shooter opened fire inside the studio. Shally told ABC7 that she realized he'd been shot when she tried waking him up after the shooter left.\n\nKao took a bullet for Shally and saved her life, her husband, Francois Ung, said in a GoFundMe for Kao's funeral expenses.\n\nKao's was a familiar face at Star Ballroom, Elizabeth Yang, a lawyer and community leader in Monterey Park, told BuzzFeed News. He was an avid dancer and went to that studio and Lai Lai every weekend, Ung wrote in the GoFundMe.\n\nFriends called him \"Mr. Nice\" because he was so welcoming to new dancers at the studios.\n\n\"Yu Kao was a free spirit, made people laugh, and loved to dance even if it was only him on the dance floor. We were close friends and treated each other as family. He was like a brother to me,\" Ung wrote.\n\n\"We will miss you Mr. Nice,\" he added. \"Keep on dancing.\"\n\n## Wen Tau Yu, 64\n\nYu had dined with his family on Lunar New Year eve before going out to celebrate with friends and never came back. His son, Szu Fa Yu, told the New York Times that his family reported him as missing the next day when he missed lunch with friends too.\n\nAlthough retired, Yu was ready for his second career and had just started studying to become a pharmacist, his son said.\n\nYu's son was unsure if his dad was shot inside the dance studio or while passing by the building. He told the New York Times that he did not know his dad as a dancer.\n\n\"When I first found out, I just could not believe it,\" Szu Fa said. \"Now, the sadness is growing.\"\n\n## Hongying Jian, 62\n\nJian and her husband, Jeff Liu went to Star Ballroom for the festivities that night, and they were separated during the shooting.\n\nLiu was hospitalized with injuries, and Jian \u2014 who went by Nancy \u2014 was missing, according to their daughter, Juno Blees.

        "article": "# Stephen Smith Said He Regrets His \"She Ain\u2019t Beyonc\u00e9\" Comment About Rihanna\n\n\"I want Rihanna to know you're a superstar,\u201d Smith said on Wednesday.\n\nStephen A. Smith visits\u00a0The Howard Stern Show\u00a0at SiriusXM Studios on Jan. 18 in New York City.\u00a0\n\nESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith clarified that he meant no disrespect to Rihanna when he said her upcoming Super Bowl halftime show wouldn\u2019t measure up to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s.\n\nIn an Instagram video posted Wednesday, Smith said he thinks no Super Bowl performance could measure up to the two that Beyonc\u00e9 has previously done.\u00a0\n\nSmith\u2019s comment came after he was asked by Sherri Shepherd on her talk show Sherri Wednesday if he was excited about Rihanna headlining the show on Feb. 12.\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a lot of things. She\u2019s spectacular,\u201d Smith told Shepherd. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing she\u2019s not. She ain\u2019t Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d\n\nShepherd responded on the show saying that Beyonc\u00e9 has had her time to perform, but now it\u2019s Rihanna\u2019s turn.\u00a0\n\nRihanna at the 80th Annual Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 10 in Beverly Hills, California.\u00a0\n\nIn Smith\u2019s Instagram video, the sports commentator said he\u2019s seen headlines about his quote on Sherri insinuating he was insulting Rihanna. He apologized and said that as a professional commentator, he should take responsibility for his words.\n\n\"I want Rihanna to know you're a superstar,\u201d Smith said. \u201cYou're sensational. You're spectacular. You're no joke. You're a worthy person to be doing the Super Bowl halftime show.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe television personality said the only reason he made the comparison was because he doesn\u2019t think any singer\u2019s halftime show could live up to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2013 headlining performance or when she joined Coldplay and Bruno Mars\u2019s show in 2015.\n\nBeyonce,\u00a0Coldplay's Chris Martin, and Bruno Mars perform at Super Bowl 50 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on Feb. 7, 2016.\u00a0\n\nSmith said anyone who is set to do a halftime show will fail to live up to those two performances. He added that even last year\u2019s show with Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Mary J. Blige, and Eminem, one of Smith\u2019s favorite artists, couldn\u2019t reach the height of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMichael Jackson could still be alive, and I\u2019d say, \u2018It\u2019s got to measure up to that,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201cI meant it as no disrespect to Rihanna. I know she is phenomenal. She's my sister. Nothing but love for her, but Beyonc\u00e9 is my sister too. I just think Beyonc\u00e9 is the greatest performer.\"\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

Thank you for being so real.\u201d\n\n## \nYou know Drew Barrymore.\n\n\n## \nThe actor, talk show host, and all-around-lovable celeb has gained a pretty solid reputation as one of the nicest people in Hollywood over the decades that she\u2019s been in the spotlight.\n\n\n## \nAnd this is partly down to how genuine Drew comes across. Just this month, for example, the 48-year-old gave fans a look at her relatably messy bedroom and candidly spoke out against the unrealistic requirements of modern-day \u201cself- care.\u201d\n\n\n## \nThis week, fans were once again left singing her praises after she documented a super raw milestone on The Drew Barrymore Show this week.\n\n\n## \nIn Monday\u2019s episode, Drew was joined by special guests Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler, who were promoting their new movie, Murder Mystery 2.\n\n\n## \nAnd during the conversation, Drew appeared flustered as she suddenly realized she was having a hot flash, which is a sudden flare of heat in the body.\n\n\n## \nRefusing to downplay the experience, Drew candidly said, \u201cI am so hot, I think I'm having my first perimenopause hot flashes.\u201d\n\n\n## \nIf you didn\u2019t know, perimenopause is \u201cthe transitional time around menopause,\u201d per Johns Hopkins Medicine, and is \u201cmarked by changes in the menstrual cycle, along with other physical and emotional symptoms.\u201d And hot flashes are just one of many symptoms that people going through perimenopause might experience.\n\n\n## \nHastily removing her blazer and fanning herself, Drew said, \u201cFor the first time, I think I\u2019m having my first hot flash.\u201d\n\n\n## \nIn response, Jennifer helped Drew readjust her microphone and rubbed her back, while quipping, \u201cOh, I feel so honored.\u201d\n\n\n## \nDrew then asked, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, do you feel this? Or maybe I'm just that excited,\u201d as Jen placed her hand on her neck and felt the heat. Adam then reached over and grabbed Drew\u2019s palm, saying, \u201cYeah, you got a hot hand.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cWell, I'm so glad I have this moment documented,\u201d Drew said.\n\n\n## \nViewers at home were quick to praise Drew for candidly acknowledging the moment, noting that they\u2019ve hardly seen celebrities with the same platform speak about hot flashes and perimenopause so openly.\n\n\n## \u201cI don\u2019t know that I have ever heard a celebrity talk about a hot flash in the moment. Thank you for being so real,\u201d one person commented under a TikTok clip of the exchange. \u201cI love that Drew keeps it so real!\u201d echoed another.\n\nI either had my first perimenopause hot flash or got really exciting! Maybe both? @thedrewbarrymoreshow \n\n## \n\u201cFirst time I have ever seen a celebrity announce this in the moment. This is amazing,\u201d someone wrote. \u201cThanks for always being real and genuine. It shines through in everything you do!\u201d another user said.\n\n\n## \nAnd fans went on to thank Drew for ultimately helping to destigmatize the subject by speaking about it on her talk show. \u201cnot there yet but super grateful for you normalising it,\u201d a fan wrote.\n\n\n## \nThis comes just days after Drew discussed her experience with perimenopause during an appearance on CBS Mornings.\n\n\n## \nSitting down with host Gayle King and CBS News correspondent Nikki Battiste, Drew recalled the moment that she first realized she was experiencing perimenopause.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI realized that I was in perimenopause when I started having my period every two weeks,\u201d she said.\n\n\n## \n\u201cOne doctor also just told me, like, this could last \u2014 on the worst-case scenario \u2014 10 years. And I was like, \u2018I will never make it 10 years like this,\u2019\u201d she added.\n\n\n## \nYou can see Drew, Gayle, and Nikki\u2019s full conversation here.\n\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

The family asks for privacy during this time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what medical complication Foxx experienced or whether he is still being treated in a hospital. Representatives for Foxx told BuzzFeed News that the family has \u201cnothing further\u201d to say as of now.\u00a0\n\nCNN reported that Foxx was hospitalized in Georgia and is under observation. According to TMZ, the actor\u2019s condition was serious enough for his family to visit him. One source told TMZ \u201che's communicating now, and that's good news.\u201d\n\nThe hospitalization came just days after Foxx was filming in Atlanta for the Netflix movie Back in Action alongside Glenn Close and Cameron Diaz. The action-comedy is Diaz\u2019s first film since she announced her retirement from acting in 2018. Diaz\u2019s last movie was 2014\u2019s Annie, which Foxx also costarred in.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

The unusual wet weather broke California\u2019s yearslong record drought conditions in most of the state. After harsh winter rains, the weather has finally settled in recent weeks, producing a historic superbloom, which is a rare desert occurrence that happens after an abundance of rainfall causes dormant seeds to germinate. This year\u2019s superbloom is so large that it can even be seen from space. The last time California saw something close to this was four years ago.\n\n\u201cThis is how we feed our souls,\u201d Heather Schneider, a rare plant biologist at the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, told the New York Times.\n\nA multitude of colorful poppies, mustard, goldfields, and other wildflowers have decorated the landscape of Monterey, San Luis Obispo, and Kern counties. Over the past few weeks, locals and tourists from out of state have made pilgrimages to take selfies near the impressive array of dazzling flowers. Places like the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve are hot spots for visitors posting their eye-catching selfies to social media.\n\nVarious wildflower species color Temblor Range on April 15, 2023 near Santa Margarita, California.\u00a0\n\nIn one of the most impressive sites of this year\u2019s superbloom, various wildflower species appear to paint the Temblor Range. It\u2019s a mountain range that touches on the east side of the San Andreas Fault at Carrizo Plain National Monument, which is about a three-hour drive north of Los Angeles. Due to heavy foot traffic during 2019\u2019s superbloom, park officials noticed patches of flowers that didn\u2019t sprout this year. Because of this, California\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation has been working to inform the public about safety and responsibility when visiting the superbloom.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that everyone has a positive experience when exploring [the flowers],\u201d State Parks director Armando Quintero said in a statement. \u201cCalifornia State Parks welcomes all to enjoy these unpredictable, rare occurrences but asks visitors to \u2018Don\u2019t Doom the Bloom\u2019 by staying on designated trails and taking only photos, not flowers.\u201d\n\nA superbloom of California golden poppies and other wildflowers in the Lancaster area of Southern California on April 11, 2023\n\nA woman zip-lines over a superbloom of wildflowers in Corona, California, on April 11, 2023.\u00a0\n\nA superbloom near Lancaster, California, on April 11, 2023\n\nA car is surrounded by wildflowers at Carrizo Plain National Monument near Santa Margarita, California, on April 15, 2023.\n\nA superbloom of California golden poppies and other wildflowers near Lancaster, April 11, 2023\n\nPeople walk amid wildflowers blooming in Carrizo Plain National Monument near Santa Margarita, California, following an unusually wet winter on April 13, 2023.\u00a0\n\nThe Temblor Range near Santa Margarita, California, on April 15, 2023\n\nBlooming poppies near the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve in northern Los Angeles County, April 14, 2023\n\nWildflowers colorize the ground at Carrizo Plain National Monument on April 15, 2023.\n\nLaila Treadwell, visiting from Atlanta, poses for photos on a field of blooming flowers near the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve, on April 10, 2023.\n\nThe Temblor Range on April 15, 2023\n\nChino Hills State Park on April 8, 2023\n\nDesert candle flowers (Caulanthus inflatus) bloom at Carrizo Plain National Monument on April 15, 2023.\n\nVisitors pose for photos in a field of blooming flowers near the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve on April 10, 2023.\n\nThe Temblor Range on April 15, 2023\n\nColorful mustard, goldfields, poppies, and other wildflowers have exploded along California's Highway 41 near Cholame, California, on April 12, 2023.

        "article": "# Forget The Candy, Get These Self-Care Gifts For Valentine\u2019s Day\n\nWhether you need a gift to show some love to your friends or a partner, everyone could benefit from more self-care in their lives.\n\nHealth & Fitness Commerce Writer\n\nIn my world, Valentine\u2019s Day is not a hugely celebrated holiday. I\u2019ve come to put it, along with New Year\u2019s, in the category of \u201cstay home at all costs and do not by any means go out into the world.\u201d I expect no major gestures or investments on the gifting front.\u00a0\n\nHowever, I always appreciate something small and thoughtful to show that you care \u2014 maybe that\u2019s something useful for the home or something that offers an opportunity to relax and focus on yourself. Valentine\u2019s Day really is the perfect opportunity for a self-care-inspired gift.\u00a0\n\nThe best part about self-care is that everyone benefits from it. Who in your life wouldn\u2019t appreciate something slightly indulgent that makes them feel good? Indulgence does not have to be expensive. There are many ways, big and small, to help your loved ones show some love to themselves this Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\n## Gifts to encourage relaxation\u00a0\n\nSpas are expensive (and difficult to get into on Valentine\u2019s Day), so one of my ideal scenarios with a romantic partner or some friends is a DIY spa night at home. Even if you\u2019re spending this fake holiday alone, a luxurious bath sounds like a pretty ideal way to celebrate. If I were trying to create my own home spa or help someone else do so, these are the products I\u2019d buy.\n\n### Luxury Bathtub Caddy Tray\n\nSome people might enjoy closing their eyes and listening to soothing music during a bath. I, on the other hand, avoid being alone with my own thoughts at all costs, but still love to soak in some bubbles every once in a while. That\u2019s where this expandable bathtub tray comes in handy. You can rest a book, phone, tablet, Kindle, or your preferred source of entertainment on it while you bathe. There\u2019s also room for a candle, a glass of water or wine, and anything else you could need in the tub.\u00a0\n\nPromising review: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with this product! Strong, beautiful, very well put together. Love it!\u201d \u2014Lisa Pearson\n\nYou can buy the Luxury Bathtub Caddy Tray from Amazon for around $51.\n\n### Diptyque Lavender Leaf-Scented Candle\n\nSpeaking of candles, I consider them to be essential for bath time. But I also generally feel like I can never have enough. I need candles in every room just in case I want to set a vibe, whether that means feeling cozy on a cold winter day, creating the perfect movie-night lighting, or trying to make the bedroom look more romantic. I enjoy a lavender scent, particularly when I\u2019m trying to boost relaxation, but the smell is a fit for almost any mood.\n\nDiptyque is a chic, classic option that will never get old. The elevated status also means it\u2019s a particularly giftable option.\n\nPromising review: \u201cI light this about 2 hours before I retire. I like how the smell is soft and is not cloying. I find that this is essential to getting a good night's sleep.\u201d \u2014crabbywoman via Nordstrom\n\nYou can buy a Diptyque Lavender Leaf-Scented Candle from Nordstrom starting at $40.\n\n### Ouai Chill Pills Bath Bombs\n\nIn case you hadn\u2019t heard, bath bombs are the new bubble bath. Lush made them trendy years ago, and they still make a great bath product, but if you\u2019re looking for something more minimalist, Ouai is the way to go. These Chill Pills bath bombs resemble a giant pill, and they\u2019re designed to help you relax into a lovely bath. They\u2019ll create a little bit of that fizz you crave from a bubble bath, release a calming jasmine and rose scent, and infuse the bathwater with oils to moisturize and smooth the skin. (Keep in mind that scented products like bath bombs can increase the risk of UTI, so you may want to avoid giving this as a gift to someone at risk.)\n\nPromising review: \u201cThis is my favorite for long, luxurious baths. I like to take an hour-long bath to relax on Friday nights. My skin always feels soft and smells great after using this. I have noticed the results usually last into the next day.\u201d \u2014KatieJW via Sephora\n\nYou can buy Ouai Chill Pills Bath Bombs from Sephora for around $30.\n\n### Himalayan Salt Lamp Night Light\n\nI love the idea of a Himalayan salt lamp. There\u2019s not much evidence to back up the claims that they can boost mood, improve sleep, or ease allergies, but there\u2019s also no harm in getting one in case it could make you feel a little bit better. Maybe it\u2019s just a placebo effect, but something about them looks relaxing. Plus, the orangey glow can definitely set a zen vibe.\u00a0\n\nConsidering my limited counter space, I\u2019d love to get this little Himalayan salt lamp night light. I could see it plugged in in the bathroom \u2014 lights off, candles lit \u2014 to set the scene for my dream bath. It\u2019s also cute and small and more affordable than most full-size lamps.\n\nPromising review: \u201cI love this nightlight! It\u2019s so cute and gives off a bright glow.\u201d \u2014Lilykb123 via Urban Outfitters\n\nYou can buy the Himalayan Salt Lamp Night Light from Urban Outfitters for around $19.\n\n### Lunya Weighted Washable Silk Sleep Mask\n\nI cannot think of anything kinder than a gift that will help you get better sleep. I\u2019m obsessed with eye masks and maintain that they are the key to falling and staying asleep no matter where you are. This one from Lunya has everything I look for in an eye mask. It\u2019s weighted, the exterior is a soft, silky material that you can throw in the wash, and it has a comfortable band that won\u2019t snag, dent, or get stuck in your hair.\u00a0\n\nPromising review: \u201cIt is pure heaven! I love everything about it from the double straps to the fabric and the weight! I\u2019ve only had it for a week but already feel like I can\u2019t sleep without it!!! If you are debating whether or not you want this let me tell you right now, YOU DO.\u201d \u2014Kayla M. via Lunya\n\nYou can buy the Weighted Washable Silk Sleep Mask from Lunya for around $88.\n\n### Hypervolt 2 Massage Gun\n\nA massage gun isn\u2019t the same experience as an actual massage, but if you\u2019re looking for a slightly bigger Valentine\u2019s Day gift that will allow your loved one to indulge and relax, you can\u2019t really go wrong with one of these. They don\u2019t have to be an athlete or super into fitness to enjoy digging into knots and loosening tense muscles right at home, but it\u2019ll be appreciated that much more by those who are regularly sore from working out.\n\nThe Hypervolt 2 from Hyperice is a good mid-level option when it comes to massage guns. It\u2019s not too big, but it\u2019s still powerful with all the functionality you need.\u00a0\n\nPromising review: \u201cAs an avid cyclist I use my Hypervolt after every ride which really helps with my recovery, don't know what I'd do without it.\u201d \u2014John M. via Hyperice\n\nYou can buy the Hypervolt 2 from Hyperice for around $229.\n\n## Skincare gifts\u00a0\n\nSkincare has almost become synonymous with self-care these days. It may not be everyone\u2019s favorite thing, but once you find products you like and get into the habit, caring for your skin can be the most relaxing and rejuvenating part of your day. Even a good hand cream can be a lovely addition to someone\u2019s day-to-day life, especially in the winter.\n\nIf your Valentine\u2019s Day gift recipient already has a solid skincare regime, they\u2019ll love a little something extra or new to rotate in. If they barely splash water on their face but want to be doing more to ward off their blemishes or dryness, one of these things may be just what it takes to get them motivated.\n\n### Kitsch Spa Headband\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen the wide array of spa headbands all over TikTok, pushing back beautiful hair while skincare or makeup routines are happening. Some of them are silly, with animal ears or wild patterns; others are cutesy with plush bows. Most recently, the Blair Waldorf\u2013esque puffy terry cloth variety has taken over. I, however, have stuck with my tried-and-true Kitsch version, and I highly recommend it.\u00a0\n\nI love that it has a Velcro closure, so I can adjust it to my head and take it on and off without pulling it fully over my face. It also has a ponytail hole on the bottom that you can slip your hair into so it doesn\u2019t fall forward into the sink when you wash your face, and you can throw it in the wash if it gets wet or tainted by foundation.\u00a0\n\nPromising review: \u201cThis is such a great product. It fits comfortably and is easy to use I would highly recommend it.\u201d \u2014Claire Spencer\n\nYou can buy the Kitsch Spa Headband from Amazon for around $16.\n\n### Disco Starter Kit\n\nFor those who are starting to dive into skincare, I have found Disco products to be a great entry point. The company was started by a man who wanted to make more \u201cman-friendly\u201d skincare products, and he seems to have succeeded. My boyfriend finally started washing AND moisturizing his face after I gave him this starter kit, enough to replenish the products himself. He\u2019s also inexplicably obsessed with the eye stick.\u00a0\n\nPromising review: \u201cThis is a great place to start if you aren\u2019t used to taking care of your skin.\u201d \u2014Gabriel R. via Disco\n\nYou can buy the Starter Kit from Disco for around $74.\u00a0\n\n### Tatcha Luminous Deep Hydration Lifting Mask\n\nEveryone loves the gal who shows up to her Galentine\u2019s Day festivities with enough sheet masks to go around. They\u2019re a fun group or solo skincare activity, and every skincare-obsessed person I know just likes to have some in stock when the urge hits. I particularly love a sheet mask because they\u2019re less messy than those drying face masks that take splashes and scrubs to get off, leaving water and debris all over the bathroom.\u00a0\n\nSome under-eye patches also make a great gift or mini group spa experience with minimal cleanup, but if you feel like a full face treatment, grab some of these lifting and hydrating sheet masks by Tatcha. They\u2019re a bit of a splurge compared to drugstore options, but love makes us do irrational things.\u00a0\n\nPromising review: \u201cExcellent result, especially the day after. I have sensitive skin that tends to look a bit lifeless and this mask really makes a noticeable difference for it to look healthier.

A friend recommended it as a lifesaver when we had mask-ne (acne from masks) at the beginning of the pandemic, and I\u2019ve been obsessed ever since. It\u2019s the most refreshing way to perk up my face, whether I\u2019m prepping my skin after I\u2019ve just woken up or need a little surge of hydration on top of the makeup I\u2019ve been wearing all day. I have it on me almost all the time and highly recommend it as a skincare gift for anyone.\n\nPromising review: \u201cThis is a great little pick me up for your skin!

This one is powerful and petite enough to keep in your bag, just in case.\n\nPromising review: \u201cWant a good bullet vibe? This is a great choice.

The upcoming convention marks one of the actor\u2019s first public engagements since she was released from her conservatorship last year.\n\nAccording to a news release, Bynes will appear on \u201990s Con\u2019s All That panel alongside former cast members Kel Mitchell, Danny Tamberelli, and Lori Beth Denberg. \u201990s Con will take place at the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford from March 17 to 19.\n\n\u201cI'm really excited to reunite with my cast mates and meet the fans at \u201990s Con,\u201d Bynes said in a press release shared with BuzzFeed News.\u00a0\n\nFans attending the convention will have access to meet-and-greets and photo opportunities with the cast. A replica of the iconic orange couch from All That will be included in the photo opportunities.\n\nThe Nickelodeon sketch series was similar to Saturday Night Live, except it was hosted by kids for a children's audience. All That aired for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2005, and Bynes appeared on the series from 1996 to 2000. Kenan Thompson, Angelique Bates, Nick Cannon, and Katrina Johnson also starred on the show in the late \u201990s and early aughts but have not been announced as \u201990s Con panelists.\n\nAll That notably spawned the spinoff series Kenan & Kel starring Thompson and Mitchell, as well as The Amanda Show, which starred Bynes. All That was rebooted in 2019 with an entirely new cast.\u00a0\n\nIn 2010, Bynes stepped away from her acting career. \u201cBeing an actress isn\u2019t as fun as it may seem,\u201d she tweeted in June of that year. \u201cIf I don\u2019t love something anymore, I stop doing it. I don\u2019t love acting anymore, so I\u2019ve stopped doing it. I know 24 is a young age to retire, but you heard it here first.\u201d\n\nHer last film to date came a few months later when Easy A, which also starred Emma Stone, was released in September 2010.\n\nLast March, Bynes was released from a nearly nine-year conservatorship. Bynes\u2019s mother, Lynn, was granted a conservatorship over Amanda after the actor exhibited concerning behavior, including an arrest for driving under the influence in 2012 and allegedly lighting a fire in front of a home in Thousand Oaks, California, in 2013.\u00a0\n\nBynes\u2019s parents supported her efforts to terminate the conservatorship, acknowledging the significant progress she has made.\u00a0\n\n\"[Lynn] looks forward to seeing the next chapter in Amanda\u2019s life as her mother, not her conservator,\u201d Lynn\u2019s attorney Tamar Arminak told BuzzFeed News last year.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# I\u2019m Doing \u201cSelf-Care January\u201d This Year And Here\u2019s Why\n\nNew year, same me \u2014 hopefully with more energy and less stress. You don\u2019t have to give up everything you love to feel better in the new year.\n\nHealth & Fitness Commerce Writer\n\nYear after year, it\u2019s the same story: New Year\u2019s resolution trends seem to revolve around fitness, weight loss, or other attempts at \u201chealthy living.\u201d The only difference I\u2019ve noticed in recent years is a newfound focus on the month of January specifically \u2014 you hear less about long-term goals for the full year and more about an extreme lifestyle change intended to last one month and one month alone.\n\nFrom Dry January to Whole30, I have fallen for this newer take on resolutions many times. Maybe it feels more doable to commit to a month of change rather than a full year. Or maybe everyone became convinced that it really does only take 21 days to form a habit (a highly disproven myth), so if they can commit to that time frame, the rest will come easily.\n\nAccording to Dr. Gail Saltz, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the New York Presbyterian Hospital, Weill-Cornell Medical College, setting extreme goals always has a lower probability of working, and aiming for instant results likely offers the lowest probability of success.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s mental health, level of stress, exhaustion, burnout, ability to mount willpower, etc., is very different from person to person at any time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to do something no matter how you\u2019re feeling, just pick something big and do it, is not very rational, probably any year but particularly when people are more emotionally taxed.\u201d\n\nJanuary is actually one of the hardest times to motivate myself to do much of anything at all. It\u2019s the dead of winter in New York. Darkness descends before 5 p.m. It\u2019s mostly cold and gray and all I want is to be cozy on my couch with some warm, comforting food. If a brighter, warmer time of year is when I get excited about being active and eating big bowls of crisp greens, why should I set that expectation for the first of the year?\n\nAll of this is why my girl Tinx has developed a different approach: Take the month of January off. An influencer known for being TikTok\u2019s \u201cbig sister,\u201d Tinx describes an approach to January that I believe to be healthier and more attainable. She follows her own tried-and-true guidelines for what makes her feel good. Her advice doesn\u2019t involve anything specific aside from doing what you can to relax and rejuvenate, because that will be different for everyone.\n\nJohn C. Norcross, a clinical professor of psychology at the University of Scranton, agrees that \u201cgiving myself a break\u201d is too rarely a resolution. He shared a summary of his research on New Year\u2019s resolutions with BuzzFeed News, and while it is more focused on how to make resolutions you can keep, it includes a suggestion that people resolve to lower their unrealistically high standards or critical expectations.\n\nAs fun as the holiday season can be, for many it\u2019s also a mentally and physically depleting time. You\u2019re traveling. You\u2019re stressed about buying gifts. You\u2019re worried about the cost of traveling and gift-giving. Your family situation may provoke anxiety. You\u2019re not getting enough sleep due to excessive holiday parties or hosting guests. You might eat all the holiday cookies and drink all the eggnog \u2014 but you don't always feel your best in the aftermath.\n\nIt\u2019s normal to indulge a little more than usual or feel overly extended in November and December. But it\u2019s also OK to take a little hiatus as you enter the new year rather than challenge yourself in ways that will deplete you further \u2014 a notion that feels like a weight is collectively lifted off the shoulders of drained people everywhere.\n\nFor Tinx, January is her month to prioritize herself and regain the energy she needs for the rest of the year. She doesn\u2019t overcommit when it comes to work or social engagements \u2014 basically, she only does what she actually wants to do. She also abstains from alcohol; however, she cuts out booze because she genuinely enjoys the break. It\u2019s not hard for her, because she\u2019s not trying to do anything that\u2019s overly difficult in her month of rest. Priorities include getting lots of sleep, avoiding stress as much as possible, and generally giving her body a break.\n\nYour self-care might involve cutting back on the sweets or the alcohol. It also might be removing the pressure to eat clean or be fully dry for a whole month and instead just find a happier balance. I don\u2019t drink much, but I definitely want to cook more (for gastrointestinal and financial purposes) and limit some foods that haven\u2019t been making me feel good lately (legumes, I\u2019m looking at you). I already exercise regularly for my mental and physical health, but since I\u2019ll be traveling from Christmas through New Year\u2019s, I\u2019m excited to get back into my fitness routine.\n\nOf course, nobody is saying that self-improvement isn\u2019t worthwhile. We all have things that we could work on. It\u2019s just psychologically more effective to aim for slow, sustainable, attainable growth rather than quick fixes whose results either disappoint or don\u2019t last.\n\n\u201cWillpower is finite. Just like using a muscle, it fatigues,\u201d Saltz said. \u201cPicking something really challenging that requires vigilance and willpower and you're already basically pooped? Then you're just asking to feel like you failed in the new year, which is not really great for anybody\u2019s mental health.\u201d\n\nSaltz acknowledged that January is culturally associated with a new start, which can spur a desire to review the year past and consider what you\u2019d like to amend in the year to come. Using it as an opportunity to evaluate and aspire is not inherently a bad thing, even if you feel stressed \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of setting yourself up for success as opposed to failure.\n\nI\u2019ve learned from all of the fad diets and juice cleanses and fitness challenges that temporary extremes don\u2019t tend to change who you are as a person. They\u2019re not likely to permanently erase your cravings or temptation or magically transform you into a brand-new version of yourself. The biggest goal I\u2019m continuously working toward is accepting who I am and what I look like, perceived weaknesses and all, instead of constantly pushing myself to change.\n\n\u201cIn terms of taking January off, if you\u2019re super burned out and super stressed, maybe your goal is to take some things off your plate in January,\u201d Saltz suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s no rule of what a \u2018resolution\u2019 has to be.\u201d \u25cf\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# The Terminally Online Version Of New York Magazine\u2019s Etiquette Rules\n\nFrom liking someone\u2019s photo posted in 2017 to getting asked about joining an MLM, here\u2019s our social media take on New York Magazine\u2019s etiquette guidelines.\n\nNew York Magazine recently published its definitive list of etiquette tips for anyone who might need them, updated with COVID precautions and things that have changed amidst the shifting social landscape. (How to deal with layoffs! How to host a dinner party with celebrities, a scenario that I am personally definitely familiar with!)\n\nSome of the rules relating to digital communication cover what we already know \u2014 unless you were born in an era without phones, texting someone \u201ck\u201d is basically like asking to get jumped, and asking friends for their consent before posting a conversation or photo online is a baseline courtesy. But there aren\u2019t a lot of firm guidelines about manners for the terminally online (all of us). Here are our recommendations for digital etiquette.\n\n## Finstas, Close Friends, And Privacy\n\n1. Don't ask to be added to someone's Close Friends or Twitter circle. That\u2019s their private platform! Asking to be invited in is as rude as walking into an acquaintance\u2019s house and expecting them to feed you.\n\n2. What\u2019s said in Close Friends stays in Close Friends. Sometimes people need to let off steam about work or subtweet a friend in peace. If you\u2019re in that select circle, they trust you to not share that around. Screenshotting, quoting, or screen recording is a breach of trust.\n\n3. Posting \u201calright who wants in ???\u201d is corny.\n\n4. A finsta with more than 100 followers is just a vlog space. You trust 100 people with your deepest, darkest secrets? Be so for real.\n\n5. Once you\u2019re not friends with someone anymore, it\u2019s best to remove them from your finsta. My friends and I cut ties with someone who had a finsta that we all followed. She also had a close friends group within the finsta where she\u2019d talk shit about me and my friends to her other friends.\n\n6. Venmo should always \u2014 always \u2014 be on private. GO PRIVATE ON VENMO THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO I ONCE FOUND OUT MY FRIEND WAS SECRETLY HOOKING UP WITH HER BOSS VIA VENMO JUST GO PRIVATE.\n\n7. You don\u2019t need to watch every TikTok your friends send. We are all overstimulated every moment of the day. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect someone to click on every link they receive.\n\n8. If you\u2019ve seen a TikTok/meme/whatever before, don\u2019t be a jerk. If a friend texts you a TikTok you've already seen, simply react with the \u201chaha\u201d and don't tell them \u201cyeah I've already seen it.\u201d\n\n9. Be considerate when using someone else\u2019s streaming login. If you\u2019re logged into an account belonging to someone you know super well who has given you access, you're good. But if you are using your friend's brother's or godmother's nephew\u2019s account to watch Ant-Man or whatever, you should only use it to watch something specific, then log out.\n\n10. If you\u2019re planning on unfollowing someone, remove them from your followers, too. Anything else just seems like a weird grab for a following ratio, which we know is a dated social media clout metric.\n\n11. Don't take it personally if someone doesn\u2019t accept your BeReal request. Sometimes people just want to keep things to an audience of three people, and that doesn\u2019t mean they hate you.\n\n12. If you put someone on FaceTime or speakerphone, you must let them know if someone else is in the room. You never know what\u2019s about to happen.\n\n## Social Scenarios\n\n13. When you\u2019re dining with people who post, let the phone eat first. Brunch overlays are not the worst crime that has ever happened! If a friend wants to take a photo of their omelet, don\u2019t deprive them of a beat to capture that nice memory.\u00a0\n\n14. No more than two food photos at the table. Brunch is nice, but there\u2019s no way it\u2019s nicer than two photos. One initial shot, and then a retake if it\u2019s blurry. That\u2019s it. The phone goes screen down on the table. Don\u2019t make people wait!\n\n15. If your friend says they are five minutes away and you see they\u2019re still at home on Find My Friends, you cannot call them out. You already know how long you actually need to wait. They are five minutes away in their heart, and you can tease them once you meet up IRL. If they\u2019re always doing this, well, that\u2019s a different conversation.\n\n16. When you meet someone at a party, you can ask for their social handles when one of you leaves. Use social media the way it was intended! Keep in touch with someone you think is cool, and send them a nice message after. Instagram if you thought they were cute, Twitter if you\u2019d like to network with them. Only if they\u2019re not online can you ask for their number, which is decidedly way more personal than your socials.\n\n17. If someone asks for your social media details and you don\u2019t want to share, just lie. \u201cI\u2019m not super online!\u201d is the best excuse. You don\u2019t owe them anything.\n\n18. If someone asks you to take a photo of them in a busy area, take three Live photos. That way they can scroll through the picture for their key photo and get a little bundle of options, and no one\u2019s phone will be clogged up with blurry photos featuring someone\u2019s half-closed eyes. No retakes. We all have places to be.\n\n19. Airdropping photos to your friends is better than texting them. What is this, 2018?\n\n20. If you see someone you matched with on an app IRL, keep it pushing. That goes for dating apps as well as platforms like Bumble BFF. The city is big. There are other people around.\n\n## Flirting And Lurking\n\n21. Liking a post while deep in the archive happens. But you need to get out of there fast. If you\u2019re stalking your ex\u2019s new partner and accidentally like their post, you must immediately unlike, make your account private, erase your bio, and change your username.\n\n22. If you\u2019re just starting to see someone, or if you have a crush, do not lurk on their Spotify. Public profiles, where people usually try to curate their presence, are fine. But anything else is too intimate. What, you want to read their diary or crack open their skull under a microscope while you\u2019re at it?\n\n23. Following someone immediately on two separate platforms means you\u2019re DTF.\n\n24. The fire react and 100 react on Instagram are inherently flirty. Please keep in mind moving forward.\n\n25. Always double-check who your Instagram story reply is going to. If you\u2019re trying to send X\u2019s story to Y, with commentary, make sure you\u2019re not sending the DM to X. And if you do get caught sending the wrong thing to someone, unsend the message and apologize as soon as possible.\n\n26. If you hooked up with someone once and they still watch your Instagram Stories, don\u2019t read into it. They\u2019re probably stuck on the subway, not thinking about you.\n\n27. When someone lets slip a piece of information they learned while lurking your social media, don\u2019t bully them about it. You don\u2019t want that energy coming back around to you, and saying, \u201cHaha, were you stalking me?\u201d is not going to make the situation feel normal again.\n\n28. Hide or mute anyone you have bad blood with from seeing your stories. Life is too short to wonder why they\u2019re watching your content. If a frenemy is watching your stories, congratulations, you won.\n\n29. Stop giving people your Snapchat when flirting. We are not 12 anymore.\n\n## Dating\n\n30. Soft launch or hard launch whenever you want \u2014 no one cares that much. People will only want the tea once you start posting about the tea.\n\n31. If you do choose to indicate a relationship change, accept that people are going to snoop. Social media is meant for other people\u2019s consumption, otherwise you\u2019d write it in a journal.\u00a0\n\n32. The first photo of your dating profile should not be a group photo. Eggs are $10 and we\u2019re fighting for Beyonc\u00e9 tickets. We don\u2019t have the time to try to figure out which one you are amidst a group of 12.\n\n33. You don\u2019t need to tell everyone that you broke up. Unless you are a reality television star sharing with your fans, your biology partner from middle school doesn\u2019t need to know that you\u2019re consciously uncoupling but going to remain friends.\n\n34. Unfollow your friend\u2019s ex out of solidarity. Or on the flip side, if the breakup is amicable, you can grant amnesty to allow everyone to follow your exes.\n\n35. Archive all the couple photos on Instagram if you\u2019re recently single. You don\u2019t owe people the details of your personal life, but if you\u2019re planning on seeing other people, it might make things a bit clearer from the get-go.\n\n## Texts, Replies, And Comments\n\n36. Text with a purpose. Never ever ever ever just text \u201cHi.\u201d State your question or thought in the first text in order to keep everyone\u2019s nerves at a healthy level.\n\n37. Schedule your FaceTimes. Calling someone out of the blue in this day and age is really anxiety-inducing!\n\n38. Texts in lowercase make things less serious, texts in Upper Case means business, and texts with punctuation are asking for a fight. Of course, this all depends if you\u2019re Gen X, Millennial, or Gen Z, but the general rule of thumb is that the younger you are, the more aware of this rule you should be.\n\n39. People over 30 need to stop using GIFs in replies. Especially that one of the woman spitting out her coffee.\n\n40. You aren\u2019t obligated to share an Instagram story every time you\u2019re tagged. Your friends know you love them in your heart. You might just not want to repost it.\n\n41. Give people a little sympathy. Digital communication never conveys intonation or intention. The best thing to do is to always try and resolve things offline, or at least over a call.\n\n42. Express your positive reactions out loud, you could make a friend. One of my favorite things to do is have a single glass of wine and reply to people's Instagram stories. Friendships are forged through story compliments. It\u2019s like a bar bathroom line.\n\n## Day-to-Day Posting\n\n43. If you\u2019re going to like the comment on someone\u2019s post, like the post itself too. If you\u2019re going to be at the party, thank the host!\n\n44. Using your account to post superficial activism infographics is weird. At this point, we\u2019ve progressed past the point of pretending it\u2019s doing anything. Share mutual aid funds you like, Venmo handles, or events that support an organization you support, but a pastel carousel about loving each other isn\u2019t action.\n\n45. Don\u2019t have interpersonal fights on any platform or in texts. If it\u2019s a stranger, you should stop, and if it\u2019s someone you actually know and care about, just fucking talk to them.\n\n46. Leave the black square up. Let everyone see that choice you made.\n\n47. Post whatever you want while assuming people are mindlessly scrolling through. It\u2019s your platform, so you reserve the right to do whatever you want with it \u2014 just keep in mind that there\u2019s probably not an excited audience on the other end. Do it for you!\n\n48. If you edit a picture, only FaceTune yourself. You might know how you like to edit your photos, but you don\u2019t want to assume what someone else\u2019s insecurities are or cause tension because you edited their appearance.\n\n## Posting About Work\n\n49. You aren\u2019t obligated to respond to someone from high school who is trying to induct you into their MLM over Facebook. Just take it as a sign of how Bethany from study hall is doing.\n\n50. Don\u2019t DM someone and ask how they got verified. Either they have a job that warranted it or they had $8 lying around.\n\n51. If you screenshot an article because it\u2019s good, include the link. Put it in the reply or name it in the video. A writer worked hard on it and not crediting their work is rude.\n\n52. Do the \u2728personal news\u2728 announcement. People might joke about the format, but the only way your network will know what you\u2019re up to is if you share it.\n\n## Second And Stan Accounts\n\n53. Tag your spoilers within two weeks of a premiere. It\u2019s just polite.\u00a0\n\n54. But also, know that if you go online, you might see spoilers. Especially after two weeks, the discourse has moved on and it\u2019s on you to watch it.\n\n55. If you find someone\u2019s stan account, don\u2019t mention it to them IRL. We all lead different lives online, and if they\u2019ve obscured their identity, they probably want to remain within their stan ecosystem. However, if it\u2019s promoting something dangerous or violent, then that\u2019s fair game.\n\n56. Not every pet needs an Instagram account. I think your dog is very cute, but not cute enough to warrant following a second account. Particularly if the posts are written as though the pet is posting. The pet cannot speak English. I\u2019m already fighting ads and random Reels to see my friends\u2019 content. There simply cannot be another thing in the mix.\n\n57. Haranguing people to follow your second account for your musical career or baby is not appropriate. Again, we\u2019re all overstimulated here. Let people consume the content they have the capacity to consume.\n\n## Interacting With Influencers\n\n58. Always ask permission to take a photo with them. Just like any other person, it\u2019s only fair to them to get their consent!\n\n59. Streamers aren\u2019t your friends and giving them money won\u2019t make them be your friend. They\u2019re at work and giving them a Tier 3 gift doesn\u2019t make you entitled to their emotions or time. They might give you a shoutout, but they don\u2019t owe you anything beyond that.\n\n60. Don't backseat game. If you think you could play better, keep it to yourself. You\u2019re here for entertainment and if you\u2019re not entertained\u2026 just exit the stream.\n\n61. Giving constructive criticism and being mean are two different things. Influencers should be held accountable for their public behavior, but if your comment doesn\u2019t make them think about the impact of their content, you\u2019re just being mean.\n\nCody Corrall, Ikran Dahir, Mary Ann Georgantopoulos, Brandon Hardin, Amber Jamieson, Lil Kalish, Alexa Lee, David Mack, Emerson Malone, Paige Skinner, Estelle Tang, Zia Thompson, Kelsey Weekman, and Venessa Wong contributed to this story.\n\n## Topics in this article\n\nSteffi Cao is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.\n\nContact Steffi Cao at steffi.cao@buzzfeed.com.\n\nGot a confidential tip? \ud83d\udc49 Submit it here\n\n",

        "article": "# Alex Murdaugh Was Convicted Of Murdering His Wife And Son\n\nThe jury deliberated for just three hours before reaching their verdict.\n\nAlex Murdaugh listens on Thursday as the jury prepares to deliberate at the Colleton County Courthouse in Walterboro, South Carolina.\u00a0\n\nAlex Murdaugh, the scion of a powerful South Carolina legal family whose scandals and secrets were laid bare after the fatal shootings of his wife and son in the summer of 2021, was found guilty on Thursday of their murders.\n\nThe guilty verdict closes a chapter on a mystery that had garnered widespread attention almost immediately after the bodies of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were found on their rural hunting lodge property in the state\u2019s Lowcountry region on June 7, 2021. As it turns out, the killer was the one to call 911 that night: their own husband and father.\n\nThe jury deliberated for just three hours before reaching their decision. After weeks of breaking down in tears in court, Murdaugh stood with his attorneys looking straight ahead and blinking as the verdict was read.\n\n\"All of the evidence pointed to only one conclusion \u2014 that's the conclusion that you all reached,\" Judge Clifton Newman told the jurors after the clerk read their verdict. \"I applaud you all for as a group, and as a unit, and individually evaluating the evidence and coming to the proper conclusion as you saw the law [and] as you saw the facts.\"\n\nMurdaugh now faces a possible sentence of life in prison. A hearing is scheduled for Friday.\n\nSpeaking outside the courthouse Thursday night, state Attorney General Alan Wilson struck a celebratory tone as he thanked prosecutors, court staff, and jurors for the long hours and attention put into the case.\n\n\u201cWow, what a great day for the people of South Carolina,\u201d Wilson said to cheers and applause. \u201cWe got to bring justice and be a voice for Maggie and Paul Murdaugh.\u201d\n\nReferencing the family's status and influence in the state's criminal justice system, Wilson said the guilty verdict proved that \u201cno one \u2014 no one, no matter who you are in society \u2014 is above the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people doubted that this process would work,\u201d the state's top prosecutor said, \u201cand hopefully for those who did doubt the process, hopefully we have instilled and put a little bit of faith back into you and your lives as you view this process as it unfolds.\u201d\n\nAlex Murdaugh, center, and his legal team\n\nThe case has transfixed true crime enthusiasts around the world with its many twists and turns. Media, too, were obsessed by the story of a wealthy and powerful small-town family brought down by scandal and tragedy. No less than two competing documentaries were produced before the case even made it to trial, while tens of thousands of people watched daily livestreams of court proceedings. More than five dozen witnesses were called to give evidence as part of the six-week trial and media frenzy that locals in the 5,000-person town of Walterboro said was unprecedented. At one point, the trial was even interrupted by a bomb threat.\n\nWhen Alex first called 911 on the night of June 7, 2021, he could surely never have imagined the firestorm of speculation and scrutiny that would begin to engulf him. In fact, prosecutors argued that his motive for killing his wife and son was to divert attention away from himself amid a \u201cgathering storm\u201d of events that was threatening to expose his many alleged financial deeds and bring ruin and scandal to the legal empire that generations of Murdaughs before him had built in the area.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe entire illusion of his life was about to be altered \u2014 he couldn't live with that,\u201d prosecutor Creighton Waters told the jury in his closing statement. \u201cHe's the kind of person for which shame is an extraordinary provocation.\u201d\n\nFor their part, defense attorneys argued that officials were sloppy in preserving or collecting evidence at the crime scene. They also suggested investigators had unfairly zeroed in on Alex as a chief suspect too early, potentially ignoring others, and noted Alex had nothing to immediately gain financially from killing his wife and son. The prosecution\u2019s case was rooted in theory, not fact, the defense argued.\n\n\u201cHe was destroyed. He was heartbroken,\u201d surviving son Buster Murdaugh testified about arriving at the property later that night having received a call from his father informing him of the killings. \u201cI walked in the door, saw him, gave him a hug \u2014 just broken down.\u201d\n\nProsecutor Creighton Waters.\n\nAbsent any witnesses to the killings, or even any guns that they could definitively pinpoint as murder weapons, prosecutors built a case based on circumstantial evidence. Some of the evidence was highly technical \u2014 data showing when cellphones were used or when they recorded steps, GPS data from Alex\u2019s car that showed his speed and location as he left the property \u2014 while other testimony essentially forced the jury to question just how much coincidence they were prepared to accept.\u00a0\n\nMaggie and Paul were each killed with types of ammunition and weapons that were all over the property, for example. Would an outside or hired killer not bring their own? Why did Alex\u2019s cellphone record him practically running shortly after the murders? Why did a seasoned lawyer and prosecutor like Alex, someone who would know about the importance of preserving potential evidence, send the family housekeeper over to clean the home the morning after the killings? And why did Alex later push both this housekeeper and his mother\u2019s caretaker to try to remember a version of events from that day that they said was not correct?\n\nAt the center of the prosecution\u2019s circumstantial case, though, was timing \u2014 specifically, the sheer volume of events that were all conspiring to come undone at the same moment for Murdaugh, threatening to ruin him. If his years of alleged thefts were uncovered \u2014 including millions that he later admitted he took from the grieving family of his family\u2019s former housekeeper who died in 2018 after a fall at the same hunting lodge \u2014 Alex was poised to lose his law license, his fortune, and his freedom.\n\nOn the very morning his wife and son were killed, the chief financial officer of Alex\u2019s law firm had confronted him about nearly $800,000 in missing fees, telling him she had reason to suspect he\u2019d stolen them. It was the first time in his years of alleged thefts from clients and the firm that someone appeared to be onto him. But, the CFO later testified, the murders brought a sudden end to any internal inquiry as colleagues rallied around Alex to support him.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlex was distraught and upset and not in the office much,\u201d said Jeanne Seckinger, the CFO. \u201cNobody wanted to harass him about nothing that we thought was really missing.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the killings also delayed a lawsuit against Alex from the family of 19-year-old Mallory Beach, who was killed in a 2019 boat crash over which Paul had been charged with involuntary manslaughter. The Beach family had been seeking a court order to force Alex to open up his finances for review, with the matter scheduled to be heard on June 10 \u2014 three days after the killings. Not only was that hearing delayed, but the entire lawsuit seemed as good as over after the deaths, Beach family lawyer Mark Tinsley testified, because juries would suddenly be immensely sympathetic to him.\n\n\u201cIf Alex had been victimized by a vigilante, nobody would have brought a verdict back against Alex,\u201d Tinsley said.\n\nIn his first words to a 911 dispatcher and responding officers at the scene, Alex pointed to the boat crash as the motive for the killings. Paul had been shunned and threatened because of the incident, Alex said, while Maggie had essentially decamped full-time to the family\u2019s beach home elsewhere in the state to avoid the negative local attention.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s what this is,\u201d Alex told the very first sheriff\u2019s deputy who arrived on the scene.\u00a0\n\nIndeed, others also immediately suspected that the murders must have been connected to the boat crash. There had been complaints that Alex and his father used their legal influence to try to interfere with the investigation into Paul, and now those close to the Murdaughs feared the family was being targeted in revenge.\n\n\u201cWe were afraid. We didn\u2019t know what was going on. My family was scared. I was scared for Alex and Buster. I thought that they needed protection. I think everybody was afraid,\u201d said Maggie\u2019s sister, Marian Proctor.\u00a0\n\nEveryone, Proctor said, except one person: \u201cAlex didn\u2019t seem to be afraid.\u201d\n\nBy far the most damning piece of evidence against Alex, though, was a video that investigators eventually recovered from Paul\u2019s phone months after the murders. Filmed by Paul just a few minutes before prosecutors contended he and Maggie were shot dead \u2014 a time estimate based on their phones both locking for a final time by 8:50 p.m. \u2014 the 50 seconds of footage showed Paul trying to corral a dog at the kennels as two voices could be heard in the background. Witness after witness identified the voices as belonging to Maggie and Alex.\u00a0\n\nAlex repeatedly told both investigators and his own surviving family that he had not seen his wife or son prior to waking up from a post-dinner nap and then driving to his mother\u2019s home. But this video proved that his version of events was not correct. He had been with them just minutes before each of their phones were locked for the final time.\n\nAlex\u2019s defense team eventually conceded the state had proven that he was with his wife and son at that point in time, but insisted that his mere presence at the scene did not indicate guilt. They also denied he was present when the pair were eventually killed, arguing that the state couldn\u2019t even definitively say when that was.\u00a0\n\nWhen Alex made the surprise decision to testify in his own defense, he was forced to admit almost immediately that he had been found out as a result of the video and that he had lied about his whereabouts before the murders \u2014 something he blamed on drug-induced paranoia. He apologized for lying to his loved ones, but insisted he had nothing to do with the killings.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, what a tangled web we weave,\u201d Alex said, quoting the 1808 epic poem Marmion by Sir Walter Scott. \u201cOnce I told the lie, and I told my family, I had to keep lying.\u201d\n\nAnother shocking piece of evidence that emerged early in the trial was a recording of an interview Alex had done with investigators three days after the murders. Asking him about a graphic photo he\u2019d seen of the extent of Paul\u2019s head wounds, prosecutors contended that Alex made a Freudian slip, of sorts: \u201cIt\u2019s just so bad. I did him so bad,\u201d they insisted he said.\n\nAlex\u2019s lawyers, however, claimed that he had in fact been saying, \u201cThey did him so bad,\u201d even calling Buster to the stand to support their interpretation of the tape.\u00a0\n\nBuster Murdaugh, the only surviving son of Alex Murdaugh, wipes away tears as witnesses are called in his father's murder trial.\n\nBuster, his girlfriend, and some of his paternal aunts and uncles attended almost every day of the trial, sitting behind Alex as a show of support. Buster testified that his father had never been violent with the family and sounded completely normal when he called him that night as he drove to his mother\u2019s home.\u00a0\n\nBut the family had secrets too. Alex told investigators he had been addicted to opioid painkillers for 20 years, sometimes spending as much as $50,000 a week on the drugs \u2014 money he said he stole from clients and law partners. Alex had done a stint in a detox facility in 2018, Buster testified, but the addiction remained a source of stress in the family right up to the murders. \u201cMom found several bags of pills in your computer bag,\u201d Paul texted his father about a month before he was killed.\u00a0\n\nLaw enforcement appeared to concede they made several mistakes during their investigation, beginning on the night of the murders. Little, if any, attempt was made to control access to the Murdaugh property, where a coterie of Alex\u2019s friends and family soon arrived to support him. Some even cleaned the house that night, potentially destroying evidence. At least one bloody footprint recovered at the scene was also ultimately found to have belonged to one of the first responders.\u00a0\n\nMost shockingly, it wasn\u2019t until September \u2014 three months after the killings \u2014 that authorities searched the home of Alex\u2019s mother, which he had visited on the night in question, ostensibly to create an alibi. Investigators came to believe Alex may have stashed the weapons there and returned in subsequent days to finally dispose of them, but they had no concrete proof for this. They did discover at the home a blue rain jacket with gunshot residue on its interior, but prosecutors struggled to prove definitively that it belonged to Alex or that he had stashed it there.\n\nThere were also signs that the state\u2019s investigation was hampered by internal errors. The lead investigator testified before a grand jury that authorities discovered blood splatter on Alex\u2019s clothing, indicating that he fired the fatal shots. But a crucial report, which the investigator said he was not aware of at the time, later found no such splatter.\n\nThe defense also tried to introduce their own technical evidence, most notably from a mechanical engineer who re-created the crime scene and analyzed the bullet trajectories, which appeared to come from someone holding the weapons at a low position. Whoever fired the shot that killed Maggie was likely a foot shorter than Alex, the engineer testified.\u00a0\n\nAgain and again, though, attempts by the defense to paint Alex simply as a loving family man came undone. A slew of witnesses who had known Alex for decades said they now felt as if they didn\u2019t truly know him and were shocked by his alleged double life of drugs and crime.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe effortlessly and easily lied to you for years, and you didn\u2019t know it?\u201d Waters, the prosecutor, asked Mark Ball, a former law firm partner and friend of Alex\u2019s who had been called by the defense.\u00a0\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know it, and didn\u2019t catch it,\u201d Ball said. \u201cThe way he was doing it was very, very cunning.\u201d\n\nThey all described their shock at hearing that Alex had been shot by the side of a rural road in 2021 on Labor Day weekend, three months after his wife and son were killed. Once again, it appeared the family was being targeted.\u00a0\n\nSoon, though, Alex himself would be charged over what authorities said was a suicide-for-hire scheme in which he paid his drug dealer to kill him so Buster would receive a $10 million life insurance payout. The plan only seemed to come undone when Alex survived and the ensuing media attention made him the prime suspect in the public eye for his family\u2019s killings.\n\nProsecutors fought throughout the trial for the jury to hear evidence of that roadside shooting, as well as the many alleged financial crimes, over the defense team\u2019s strenuous objections. The inclusion of the evidence dramatically lengthened the trial, but prosecutors insisted it was central to understanding his alleged motive and to make clear \u2014 as he sat in the court each day crying over his dead wife and son \u2014 that he was not who he appeared to be.\n\n\u00a0\u201cDid you really know Alex Murdaugh?\u201d Waters asked Seckinger, the law firm\u2019s CFO.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever really knew him,\u201d she replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows him.\u201d\n\nStephanie K.

        "article": "# Andy Cohen Was Left Completely Speechless While Being Called Out For Supporting Jen Shah After She Pleaded Guilty To Fraud And The Whole Thing Is So Awkward\n\nOn Jan. 6, former Real Housewives star Jen Shah was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for running a nationwide fraud scheme.\n\n## \nAndy Cohen landed himself in hot water during an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace this week.\n\n\n## \nThe roles were reversed as the Bravo executive \u2014 known for grilling cast members on the Real Housewives franchise \u2014 was questioned about his support of former Salt Lake City Housewife Jen Shah, who was sentenced to six and a half years in prison on Jan. 6 for committing fraud.\n\n\n## \nShah has appeared on all three seasons of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City starting in 2020, with her arrest in Utah in March 2021 even being documented in a Season 2 episode.\n\n\n## \nFor a bit of context, Shah and her \u201cfirst assistant\u201d Stuart Smith were accused of running a nationwide telemarketing scheme that defrauded hundreds of older adults by selling them \u201cbusiness services.\u201d\n\n\n## \nProsecutors alleged that these \u201cservices\u201d were \u201cjust fraudulent schemes, motivated by greed, to steal victims\u2019 money.\u201d\n\n\n## \nSoon after her arrest in April 2021, Shah pleaded not guilty to the charges and publicly maintained her innocence, telling Cohen and her castmates during the RHOSLC Season 2 reunion: \u201cI\u2019m fighting this. I am innocent.\u201d\n\n\n## \nThree months later on July 11, Shah changed her tune, pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n\n\n## \nDuring the CNN interview, Wallace questioned Cohen all about his success as an executive producer on 10 different Housewives franchises, leading them to discuss Shah\u2019s sentencing.\n\n\n## \n\u201cYou\u2019re on the record last November as saying that you hope she would get no jail time,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cAnd the question I have is, \u2018Why would you take her side against the thousands of people she defrauded, including a lot of elderly?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n## \nAs Wallace spoke, Cohen winced at the accusation and became visibly uncomfortable, before attempting to account for himself.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI think I was hoping she was actually innocent,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d\n\n\n## \nBefore he could finish his sentence, Wallace hit back: \u201cShe pleaded guilty!\u201d\n\n\n## \nCohen continued to defend himself by trying to correct the timeline of events.\n\n\n## \n\u201cThat was before she pleaded guilty, I mean, that I said that, I would think?\u201d he responded, now sounding unsure of himself.\n\n\n## \nWallace pointed out again that his comments came after Shah\u2019s guilty plea in July, leaving Cohen struggling for words.\n\n\n## \n\u201cOh, really?\u201d he said, evidently stunned in embarrassment. \u201cOh, god. Um, anyway! Wow, this is fun,\u201d he added with an awkward laugh.\n\n\n## \nWallace was seemingly referring to quotes that Cohen gave to Us Weekly on Nov. 17 ahead of Shah\u2019s sentencing when he was asked if she might return for a fourth season on RHOSLC.\n\n\n## \nHe told the outlet at the time: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to people who want her on the show. I hope that she gets no jail time whatsoever and she can come right back \u2026 but I have a feeling that she\u2019s not going to be available to be on the show.\u201d\n\n\n## \nStriving to contextualize the comments to Wallace, Cohen said people were \u201cdemanding\u201d to know the \u201cstatus\u201d of Shah\u2019s involvement in the hit show.\n\n\n## \n\u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s up to the judge. She\u2019s about to get sentenced to a lot of jail time,\u2019\u201d he recalled, before Wallace interjected to remind him that Shah did \u201csomething bad.\u201d\n\n\n## \nCohen agreed that Shah is deserving of jail time, but added: \u201cSometimes you get to know someone and you get to like them, you hope that they are not guilty of something horrible.\u201d\n\n\n## \nShah has been ordered to surrender to authorities on Feb. 17, marking the start of her sentence at a federal penitentiary in Texas, according to TMZ.\n\n\n## \nNew documents obtained by the outlet also indicate that she will be required to participate in a mental health treatment program upon her release.\n\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

One person argued: \u201cGirl she is just at a bar getting a drink\u2026.. bffr.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cThis is so stupid.. she\u2019s having fun with her childhood friends in London..\u201d someone else wrote.\n\n\n## \nBut now a behind-the-scenes insight into how that viral photo came to be has highlighted the stark difference between Instagram and reality as it proved just how far removed Kim really is from everyday life.\n\n\n## \nThe second photo was taken by Dominic Turner, and shared to Twitter by his friend Dan Zetterstr\u00f6m.\n\n\n## \nAnd while Kim may be able to exude the appearance of a regular person enjoying a pint in some posts, this new image paints a completely different picture.\n\n\n## \nHere you can see that Kim isn\u2019t just enjoying a beer with her friends while on vacation as some fans argued, she\u2019s actually filming content for what is assumed to be her family reality show, The Kardashians.\n\n\n## \nIn a wide shot photo of the pub, Kim and her pals are surrounded by a camera crew, with several people adorned with filming equipment \u2014 including lighting to ensure that the star looks nothing less than flawless at all times.\n\n\n## \nThere is even a camera operator behind the bar to secure footage of Kim from every angle, making it obvious that this trip wasn\u2019t the spontaneous St. Paddy\u2019s Day celebration that it was initially made out to be.\n\n\n## \nTweeting a side-by-side of Kim holding the drinks in the pub and the long shot image, one person admitted: \u201cdisappointed to learn that this was the insta vs reality of kim k in the pub.\u201d\n\n\ndisappointed to learn that this was the insta vs reality of kim k in the pub\n\n## \n\u201cA 4 cam production team following your every move seems terrible,\u201d another user replied.\n\n\n## \n\u201cKim is not going to a Pub to be around common folk,\u201d someone else agreed.\n\n\n## \n\u201cTheir reality isn't our reality,\u201d one more wrote.\n\n\n## \nAnd the replies to Dan\u2019s original tweet garnered a similar response, with one person writing: \u201cImagine that being normal to you?

        "article": "# TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew Appeared Before Congress And Now The Fan Edits Are Rolling In\n\n\u201cCongress just turned this man into the main character.\u201d\n\nVideo collages and thirsty comments dedicated to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew have begun to pop up on the platform following the CEO's testimony to Congress yesterday, when he spent five hours defending the platform in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nOn TikTok, fan edits dedicated to the 40-year-old have declared him \u201cTikTok daddy\u201d and \u201cthe finest ceo of our generation.\u201d\n\nChew was in the hot seat fielding questions from lawmakers on the future of the popular video-sharing app, which currently has over 150 million monthly users in the United States alone.\u00a0\n\nBoth Democratic and Republican politicians have expressed concerns over the app\u2019s China-based parent company and what it means for user safety, data privacy, and national security. Some lawmakers have called for the platform to be banned in the US over worries that its parent company, ByteDance, could or would share American user data with the Chinese government. In his testimony, Chew said there was no evidence the Chinese government had ever accessed user data.\n\n\u201cLet me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country,\u201d Chew said in the written statement that started his testimony.\u00a0\n\nThere are currently three bills in Congress that could affect American access to TikTok. Two would legislate an outright ban of the platform, while the other would give the government the power to ban any technologies that are deemed a national security risk.\n\nYesterday\u2019s hearing put the TikTok CEO in the spotlight as he asserted banning the app would be harmful to millions of American businesses, and that a new subsidiary named Project Texas would provide a meaningful solution that would allow the app to remain active in the US.\u00a0\n\nWhile lawmakers looked to be unconvinced, Chew\u2019s defense of the application, including his praise for subcommunities within the app, like \u201cBookTok,\u201d a community for people to discuss reading recommendations, seemed to strike a chord with those who have found inspiration on the platform.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOnline, a growing group of creators appeared impressed by Chew\u2019s performance despite the tense nature of the hearing and have shown their admiration in the most organic way: by creating fan edits and memes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCan we talk about how hard he is working for us to prevent the ban\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83d\udc95#ceo #tiktok #tiktokban #fuckcongress #congress #pedropascal #pedropascaledit #work #werk #foryou #fyp #foryoupage #ShouChew #king #popoff @tiktok @tiktokglobal @tiktoktrends \n\nthis app is single-handedly keeping the global economy from tanking so help me understand the problem. #capcut #tiktokcongressionalhearing #tiktokceo\u2764\ufe0f \n\n\u201cThis app is single-handedly keeping the global economy from tanking so help me understand the problem,\u201d one creator captioned her video, which features a green screen collage of Chew in action.\n\n\u201cI had zero opinion of him before but now I like this dude,\u201d one commentator wrote.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe USA congress just made this man america most eligible bachelor AND HE AINT EVEN AMERICAN,\u201d another said.\u00a0\n\n(For clarity, Chew is neither eligible nor a bachelor. Chew is married to Vivian Kao, whom he met in 2008 when they were both attending Harvard Business School.)\u00a0\n\n\u201cZuckerberg is just mad bc he could never be this fine,\u201d another wrote, referencing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has also testified in front of Congress.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFollowing the hearing, a representative from TikTok issued a statement to BuzzFeed News criticizing the inquiry as \u201cpolitical grandstanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cShou came prepared to answer questions from Congress, but, unfortunately, the day was dominated by political grandstanding that failed to acknowledge the real solutions already underway through Project Texas or productively address industry-wide issues of youth safety,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nTikTok users also had plenty of criticism for lawmakers for their handling of the hearing and some of the questions directed at the CEO, including very basic questions such as whether the app accessed users\u2019 home Wi-Fi networks and more complex ones such as whether its parent company ByteDance had spied on Americans at the request of the Chinese government.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t let the poor man talk or explain anything,\u201d one poster said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll these 80+ year old gov people have never touched this app let alone be asking questions about it,\u201d another wrote.\n\nceo of tiktok>u.s congress #tiktokban #tiktok #edit #freetiktok #fyp\u30b7 #viral #videostar #government #america #shouzichew #vsp \n\nShou Zi Chew Crew #shouzichew #tiktokceo #congressionalhearing \n\ncome through for us shou oppa\n\nAs BuzzFeed News reported last year, on several occasions in 2021 and 2022, ByteDance employees accessed nonpublic US TikTok user data. In December, ByteDance said in a statement that an internal investigation revealed that personal TikTok user data, including that of the BuzzFeed News reporter who broke the story as well as several other journalists who cover TikTok, had been accessed without authorization by ByteDance employees who were then fired.\n\nAhead of Chew\u2019s appearance, TikTok appeared to engineer support for the platform by sponsoring influencers to participate in a demonstration on March 23, at Capitol Hill.\u00a0\n\nAccording to Wired, TikTok covered either the travel and or hotel accommodation expenses for more than 30 influencers at the orchestrated news conference in Washington, DC, as confirmed by a TikTok spokesperson.\u00a0\n\nThe love emerging online is new for Chew, who, until recently, kept a low profile. His personal TikTok account had stalled at just under 18,000 followers as of March 22, but has now amassed more than 70,000 new followers since his testimony, according to the media analytics site Social Blade.\u00a0\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\nAde Onibada is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in London.\n\nContact Ade Onibada at ade.onibada@buzzfeed.com.\n\nGot a confidential tip? \ud83d\udc49 Submit it here\n\n",

        "article": "# At Least Seven People Were Killed In A Shooting In Half Moon Bay, California\n\nThe shooter was identified as 66-year-old Chunli Zhao, and he is in custody.\n\nLaw enforcement personnel control the scene of a shooting on Jan. 23, in Half Moon Bay, California.\n\nA shooter killed at least seven people at a mushroom farm and another location in Half Moon Bay, California, on Monday, local officials said.\n\nThe San Mateo County sheriff's office identified the shooter as Chunli Zhao, a 66-year-old man, and local media footage captured the moment he was taken into custody in the parking lot of a sheriff's office station. (Other officials earlier on Monday had identified him as Zhao Chunli.)\n\nThe victims \u2014 who have not yet been publicly identified \u2014 are believed to have been workers on the farm. In a press conference Tuesday, officials said the shooter also worked on the farm, saying it was believed to be a case of \"workplace violence.\"\n\nA suspect is now in custody in the Half Moon Bay shootings. Here's the intense moment it happened - caught on video by our @abc7newsbayarea camera\n\nChristina Corpus, the\u00a0San Mateo County sheriff, said during a news conference that deputies were dispatched at 2:22 p.m. Monday and found four people dead from gunshot wounds as well as another person with life-threatening injuries. Deputies then discovered three more bodies at a separate scene about a mile away. At least one scene was described by local officials as a mushroom farm, and Corpus told reporters they were both nurseries.\n\nThe motive is unknown, Corpus said, but police believed the shooter acted alone. Because the shooting occurred in the afternoon, when school was over for the day, there were children who witnessed the shooting. \"For children to witness this is unspeakable,\" she said.\n\nDavid Oates, a spokesperson for California Terra Garden, the company that owns the farm where one of the shootings occurred, confirmed to BuzzFeed News that four of the victims as well as a fifth person who was injured and the suspect all worked at the farm.\n\n\"We remain shocked and grief-stricken over the senseless loss of four of our friends and long-time employees,\" Oates said in a statement Tuesday, \"and we pray for the team member that remains in critical condition.\"\n\nCorpus told reporters at another news conference on Tuesday afternoon that the surviving worker was being treated at Stanford Hospital and was in stable condition.\n\nThe shooter legally owned his gun, the sheriff told CNN on Tuesday morning, noting that he was not previously known to law enforcement. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a red flag for us, nothing to put him on our radar,\" she said.\n\nBut the shooter did have a history of violent threats against coworkers, according to court records first obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. In 2013, a man who worked with Zhao at a restaurant reportedly filed a restraining order against him, alleging that Zhao had once attempted to smother him with a pillow and threatened he \"would use a kitchen knife to split my head.\"\n\nOates told BuzzFeed News that California Terra Garden, which acquired the farm in March 2022, was unaware of any disputes or issues involving Zhao prior to Monday's shooting. He said Zhao did work at the farm, which primarily grows mushrooms, for at least several years prior to the company taking over, but he did not have additional details about his employment history.\n\n\"No previous incident report or concerns raised,\" Oates said in an email.\n\nThe mass shooting was one of several in California in just a three-day span. On Saturday, 11 people were killed and nine more were injured at a ballroom dance venue in Monterey Park, a predominantly Asian American suburb of Los Angeles. On Monday, just hours after the tragedy in Half Moon Bay, one person was killed and seven more were injured in a shooting in Oakland.\n\n\"We are sickened by today\u2019s tragedy in Half Moon Bay,\" David Pine, president of the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors, said in a statement Monday. \"We have not even had time to grieve for those lost in the terrible shooting in Monterey Park.\"\n\nLocal and state officials pointed to California's strict gun laws as they spoke about the tragedies, but that clearly more needs to be done to reduce deaths caused by gun violence.\n\n\"Gun safety works,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said during a news conference in Half Moon Bay Tuesday. \"We will not back away from that resolve, but we can't do this alone and with all due respect, we feel like we are.\"\n\n\"[The] federal government needs to do its job,\" he later added.\n\nJosh Becker, a California state senator, tweeted, \"When is enough going to be enough for this country?????\"\n\n7 people now dead in Half Moon Bay Shootings today. When is enough going to be enough for this country?????\n\nOn Monday, Newsom tweeted that he was at a hospital meeting with victims of the Monterey Park shooting when he got word about the Half Moon Bay mass shooting.\n\n\"At the hospital meeting with victims of a mass shooting when I get pulled away to be briefed about another shooting,\" he said. \"This time in Half Moon Bay. Tragedy upon tragedy.\"\n\nDuring his remarks on Tuesday, the governor took a moment to call out House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who represents California's Central Valley where many of the state's farmworkers live and work, and other Republicans who have fought back against gun control measures.\n\n\"We haven't heard one damn word from him. Not since Monterey park \u2026 not one expression of prayers even,\" Newsom said. \"It should surprise nobody.\"\n\nThe\u00a0American Public Health Association\u00a0says\u00a0gun violence\u00a0in the US is a public health crisis. It is a leading cause of premature death in the country,\u00a0responsible for more than 38,000 deaths\u00a0annually. As of Jan. 24, at least 1,217 people have already died from gun violence this year, and another 1,584 have died by suicide,\u00a0according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. In\u00a02022, more than 20,000 people died from gun violence, with over 24,000 additional gun deaths by suicide.\n\n## \nUPDATE\n\n\nAn earlier version of this article, using information provided by officials, misstated the suspected shooter\u2019s age.

Defendants cut comers; ignored reports of multiple, unscripted firearms discharges; and persisted, rushed and understaffed, to finish the film,\u201d the complaint reads.\u00a0\n\nMovie set of Rust\u00a0at Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe\n\nAccording to the suit, the crew members were in close range of Baldwin when he pointed the revolver at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, killing her and injuring director Joel Souza. Prosecutors in New Mexico charged Baldwin in January with two counts of involuntary manslaughter following an investigation into the shooting. He has pleaded not guilty.\u00a0\n\nThe crew members claim in the lawsuit that they suffered \u201cblast injuries\u201d from the \u201cdeafening\u201d sound of the gun\u2019s discharge.\u00a0\n\nPrice \u201cfelt the physical force of the gunfire in the small space,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cHis ears began to ring. He felt as if everything was moving in slow motion. He saw Souza screaming and crawling away from Defendant Baldwin. Desperate and scared, crew members began to yank Plaintiff Price by the shirt and out of the church.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAddiego, who also \u201cfelt the same disorienting sound, force, and physical trauma from the gunshot,\u201d rushed over to Souza and applied pressure on his wound until medics arrived.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCurtin, who saw Hutchins fall to the ground in front of her, tried to help the cinematographer before she was ushered outside, where she collapsed from \u201cthe effects of the blast and the shock of the shooting.\u201d\n\nThe complaint further states that the crew members were not offered any \u201cmeaningful emotional or mental health services\u201d by the producers and had to find their own support.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs have independently sought support in dealing with their injuries which include, but are not limited to, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder,\u201d the complaint reads.\u00a0\n\nThe lawsuit also faults Baldwin and the producers for not following safety protocols on set. New Mexico prosecutors have said that the actor had ignored \u201cthe first rule of gun safety\u201d when he pointed the gun at Hutchins.\n\n\"Had Baldwin performed the required safety checks with the armorer, ... this tragedy would not have occurred,\" prosecutors wrote in a probable cause statement. \"If Baldwin had not pointed the gun at Hutchins ... this tragedy would not have occurred.\"\n\nBaldwin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement to BuzzFeed News, Jacob G. Vigil, the attorney representing the crew members, said the lawsuit was filed to end the practices that led to Hutchins\u2019s death.\u00a0\n\n\u201cProduction of the gun-heavy western film required an experienced firearms expert and safety-minded leadership. Rust had neither,\u201d Vigil said in a statement. \u201cInstead, producers contracted an inexperienced armorer and set leaders with histories of safety violations.\u201d\n\n## More on this\n\n",

        "article": "# The Mindy Kaling Backlash Has Lost All Nuance\n\nRecent criticism of the comedian\u2019s artistic laziness has fans reexamining her whole career.\n\nWhen Velma, HBO\u2019s animated series about Scooby-Doo\u2019s Velma Dinkley, premiered last week, few could have predicted the backlash it would generate against its star, Mindy Kaling, who voices the titular character and serves as an executive producer. The series, long marketed as a race-swapped, adult version of the Scooby-Doo cartoons, was expected to offend right-wing vloggers irritated that Hollywood wokeness had made all these classic white characters into characters of color, but it also went the extra mile by pissing off progressive fans.\u00a0\n\nThe complaints were varied. Some were about how HBO ruined a perfectly good children\u2019s show by trying to make it edgy. Others were about how unsubtle and unfunny the show\u2019s point of view is. In particular, Kaling\u2019s Velma makes a joke about how she \u201cspit[s] truth without a filter, like every comedian before #MeToo,\u201d which has made the rounds of the internet as further evidence of Kaling\u2019s careless conservatism. (She also recently received criticism for saying The Office couldn\u2019t succeed today due to \u201ccancel culture.\u201d) As with this example, most of the criticism that started with the show expanded rapidly outward, until the crux of the anger landed squarely on Kaling\u2019s career.\u00a0\n\nVelma has opened up a discourse about Kaling\u2019s long career of writing and performing a specific kind of Indian woman: dorky, self-absorbed, insecure, obsessed with attaining the romantic validation of caustic white guys, and eager to fling herself, her family, her culture, and other cultures under the bus to get it. From Mindy Lahiri of The Mindy Project to Devi Vishwakumar of Never Have I Ever to Bela Malhotra of The Sex Lives of College Girls to Velma, Kaling\u2019s Indian protagonists tend to follow a similar pattern. Mindy, Devi, and Bela all fall for nerdy white dudes who started out as their rivals:\u00a0Danny, a fellow doctor in Mindy\u2019s residency; Ben, Devi\u2019s high-achieving high school classmate; and Eric, the leader of the comedy group Bela wants to join. Velma, who makes fawning eyes at Fred Jones, the entitled heir to his father\u2019s fortune, is set up to do the same.\n\nAn initial tongue-in-cheek defense of Kaling\u2019s \u201cobsession with a specific type of White Man\u201d offered this explanation: \u201cYou have to remember [she] spent formative sexual years at Dartmouth over 20 years ago. That's all there was. New England changes people.\u201d The tweet, now viewed close to 9 million times, gets at one element of the controversy over Kaling\u2019s work. Kaling\u2019s characters have always been caricatures of herself. This was clearly true of Mindy on The Mindy Project, where Kaling played someone with her own name. But Bela, an aspiring comedian and Seth Meyers fan who attends a liberal arts college in New England, is no less obvious a parody of Kaling. The collapse between Kaling\u2019s onscreen personas and actual personhood has fueled the fire of online anger. As the critiques of Kaling\u2019s characters escalate, so too does the demand for Kaling\u2019s accountability.\u00a0\n\nMore damning than her characters\u2019 obsession with white guys is their casually racist self-hatred. In one of Bela\u2019s first lines of The Sex Lives of College Girls, she calls herself \u201can Indian loser.\u201d In the opening scene of Never Have I Ever, Devi prays for \u201c[her] arm hair to thin out,\u201d saying, \u201cI know it\u2019s an Indian thing, but my forearms look like the frigging floor of a barbershop.\u201d Velma gets the same treatment; five minutes into the pilot, two cops make fun of her weight and her \u201chairy gorilla arm.\u201d It\u2019s sad to see these young protagonists introduced to the audience with such self-loathing jokes; it\u2019s like the writers are anticipating viewers\u2019 inherent disgust with young Indian women and trying to beat them to the punchline. It\u2019s also boring to see the same racist stereotypes and beauty standards trotted out again and again. Plus, it\u2019s baffling to see Kaling, one of the most successful Indian women in Hollywood, undermine her own creation. Having gotten far enough in her career to create her own TV shows centering young Indian girls, why mock them?\n\nSome viewers have argued that Kaling\u2019s work has always been white-facing and power-chasing. They see her characters\u2019 love of white men and hatred of themselves as unified in Kaling\u2019s artistic perspective on the world: one that craves privilege and seeks to distance itself from otherness. In a measured Catapult essay about the legacy of The Mindy Project, Zeahaa Rehman evaluates the show\u2019s sparse depiction of Mindy\u2019s racial and cultural background. On the one hand, Rehman sees the value in decentering Mindy\u2019s Indian identity. Kaling received pressure from \u201cwhite executives at TV networks\u201d to make her show about \u201can Indian woman \u2026 educating white people,\u201d and she explicitly wanted to avoid being pigeonholed. Kaling refused to let Mindy be the gateway Indian character for white audiences to empathize with Indian people, instead leaning into Mindy\u2019s messiness. But Rehman still expresses discomfort with \u201cMindy\u2019s unwillingness to engage with her culture unless it was for a punchline.\u201d She rarely ate Indian food, although \u201cfood played a large role in [her] life,\u201d or interacted with other Indian people. She existed in something of an identity vacuum.\n\nIn Kaling\u2019s later work, she spent more time exploring the cultural backgrounds of her Indian characters. But recent criticism of this work highlights her unquestioned regurgitation of the anti-Islam sentiment that exists in Hindu Indian communities, as in a 2020 episode of Never Have I Ever. In an essay for Autostraddle about the disappointments of the show, Himani addresses that episode, in which Devi\u2019s family attends Ganesh puja, a Hindu festival and social event. While there, they meet a recently divorced woman whose family rejected her after she married a Muslim man, and who now regrets not choosing to marry a Hindu man in the first place. Though Himani appreciates Kaling\u2019s attempt to \u201c[lay] bare the Islamophobic underbelly of Hindu-Indian community,\u201d she also calls it \u201ca missed opportunity\u201d to challenge the internal prejudices of the Indian community and depict them as something other than inevitable cultural idiosyncrasies. By the end of the episode, the divorced woman seems wrong for defying her parents\u2019 anti-Islam prejudice, not the other way around.\u00a0\n\nThese criticisms of Kaling\u2019s work have unspooled online amid a flurry of other tangentially related revelations presented as evidence that she deserves this downfall. There\u2019s the fact that her brother wrote a book called Almost Black: The True Story of How I Got Into Medical School By Pretending to Be Black, which is self-evidently exploitative and racist. There\u2019s the fact that she liked one of JK Rowling\u2019s tweets, in which the famously anti-trans author boasted about her \u201crecent royalty cheques\u201d in response to someone asking how it felt to lose a huge chunk of her audience. Liking a tweet is fairly trivial evidence of being a TERF, but there\u2019s also a line from Kaling\u2019s 2011 memoir, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, in which she derides her trans neighbors in West Hollywood, a predominantly queer neighborhood in LA. It\u2019s all unflattering, but the storm eclipses the nuanced critiques of Kaling\u2019s work in favor of a punitive, burn-it-down attitude.\u00a0\n\nThis is not especially surprising. By now it\u2019s well established that social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok reward highly emotional engagement. Outrage and sarcasm are the most virulent sentiments; bluntness and brevity make them easier to spread. The people in charge of and invested in social media companies make money using algorithms that encourage us to click on increasingly frenetic or radical content. They profit off tools that make us want to keep shouting into the void, waiting to hear back.\n\nIf we had a better forum for this kind of critical discourse, it might be easier to articulate the reasonable \u2014 even boring \u2014 consensus at the heart of all this controversy: Kaling has written the same caricature of herself too many times.\u00a0\n\nWhen a young brown girl appears onscreen in one of Kaling\u2019s shows, it\u2019s easy enough to guess where her story is going. She will probably be a loud-mouthed nerd with strict parents and insecurities about her body hair, fixated on a white dude who is little more than rude to her. She will probably not question the rigid social hierarchy she\u2019s inherited; in fact, she\u2019s probably going to enact it, cruelly, on herself and others. Viewers are bored with the artistic laziness of these plotlines \u2014\u00a0both in their repetitiveness and their reliance on outdated stereotypes. It\u2019s certainly a sign that Kaling\u2019s comedy has gotten stale, and that her politics have fallen behind the times. But it\u2019s also clearly a symptom of the fact that there are few Indian women of Kaling\u2019s stature and renown making TV today. There aren\u2019t enough other stories about young Indian girls to offset or complicate the narratives Kaling has chosen to retread again and again.\u00a0\n\nThis highly justified frustration has manifested as personal vitriol directed at Kaling because it\u2019s easier that way. \u201cMindy Kaling\u201d is a perfectly packaged trending topic that people can engage with. She's a woman in comedy who has historically been criticized for her weight, her voice, and her darker skin; we've found new ways to target her, but she's still a public figure we love to hate. She\u2019s so much like her characters that we believe their faults are her faults. The now-popular refrain, \u201cMindy Kaling, just because you are an Indian loser, does not mean Indians are losers!\u201d takes the frustration with her overdone caricature and makes it seem like Kaling is portraying all Indian women as self-hating freaks. But she\u2019s not. She\u2019s just portraying herself, stylized as a self-hating freak, over and over again. And it\u2019s boring. But her work is only a lightning rod for online anger because it looms so large above other Indian American media. It\u2019s a small sliver of possible stories that\u2019s been amplified by Kaling\u2019s peerless fame. She ought to have more peers disrupting her monopoly, but the robust and necessary criticism of her work ought to hold more water than the gleeful revelry in her personal demise. \u25cf\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# The Time Has Come To Retire The \u201cGlee\u201d Curse\n\nThe Price of Glee takes a lurid look at the infamous series.\n\nThe cast of Glee\u00a0in 2009.\u00a0\n\nIn 2009, a technicolor wonder premiered on Fox. Ryan Murphy\u2019s show about a motley group of high school singers was bright and funny, with familiar archetypes of misfits and popular kids, plus an air of the ridiculous and a touch of the sweet. Fourteen years later we\u2019re still talking about Glee \u2014\u00a0and about the sprawling cast of Hollywood newbies it launched to a nauseating stratosphere of fame.\u00a0\n\nA jukebox musical, Glee derived power from the zeitgeist \u2014\u00a0from replaying pop culture moments (the good: the show\u2019s mashup of \u201cRumour Has It\u201d and \u201cSomeone Like You\u201d; the bad: \u201cWhat Does the Fox Say\u201d) and also creating them. It raked in 32 Emmy nominations, Oprah interviewed the cast, and the stars went on two national tours, the latter of which culminated in 2012\u2019s Glee: The 3D Concert Movie. The show\u2019s compilation albums were such a hit that in 2012 the Glee cast collectively ranked as the eighth-best-selling digital artist of all time.\u00a0\n\nFor the millions of young millennials who tuned in, Glee marks a clear point in time: a pre-Trump coming of age, an era of vivacity and rapid cultural momentum. The show made huge strides in queer representation on TV. By the show\u2019s end so many characters fell under the LGBTQ umbrella that the few who didn\u2019t were token straight friends. Glee played out gooey teen love stories that had never been gifted to queer audiences before \u2014\u00a0not that boldly, nor in that quantity.\u00a0\n\nBut the show\u2019s legacy has been complicated. Rocky. Glee epitomized a loud, earnest millennial sensibility that fell out of favor in the later 2010s. The show could be cloying and out of touch. Teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) sang Coldplay with his students, lamenting that he couldn't \u201cfix\u201d his girlfriend's (Jayma Mayes) mysophobia and OCD. Gwyneth Paltrow, playing a provocative substitute teacher, sang a perplexing version of CeeLo Green\u2019s \u201cFuck You.\u201d And though the show purported to be satire, that couldn\u2019t save its straight-faced rendition of \u201cGangnam Style.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThen there was the behind-the-scenes drama. The show\u2019s cast members were magnets for Hollywood gossip: feuds, bullying, racism, drugs, multiple instances of domestic violence, arrests, and the deaths of cast members Cory Monteith, Naya Rivera, and Mark Salling all made headlines.\u00a0\n\nIt was only a matter of time before someone would attempt a relitigation of the series,\u00a0give it the E! True Hollywood Story treatment. Glee was so popular, its cultural presence so garish, its celebrity gossip mill evergreen. Someone had to make sense of this messy mythos eventually. Right?\n\nEnter The Price of Glee, a three-part ID and Discovery+ docuseries that premieres today. Produced by Ample Entertainment, most famous for minor series like Queen of Versailles Reigns Again, the limited series attempts to tell viewers the truth behind the show\u2019s controversial offscreen tragedies, colloquially known as the Glee curse. But The Price of Glee is quite literally the true crime-ification of a Twitter joke. A lurid depiction of real-life traumas that are incongruously spliced together, it\u2019s ghoulish, an example of what happens when Hollywood myth-making crosses the line.\u00a0\n\nLea Michele as Rachel, left, and Cory Monteith as Finn in season 3 of Glee.\n\nGlee gave us a lot to talk about. Whether you were a young fan, an old critic, or a good old-fashioned gossip hound, there was something to feast on for everybody. This was a hit show starring hot young people who lived, loved, fought, and died very publicly. People really love a Hollywood curse. Scandal, after all, is fun. True crime coverage is ubiquitous, and people crave a good, juicy narrative. Curses activate a key thrill for the average culture vulture: the satisfaction that, hey, at least that's not your life.\u00a0\n\nBut \u201cthe Glee curse\u201d soon became shorthand for any moment of perceived negativity attached to a former Glee cast member. The phrase popped up again in 2020, when former cast member Samantha Ware, who played Jane Hayward in Season 6, accused Lea Michele of being a racist bully on set \u2014 as if Michele\u2019s alleged actions had a supernatural origin. When Matthew Morrison was fired from So You Think You Can Dance last June, at least one newspaper referenced the curse. Some Twitter users invoked the curse to lament the fact that Amber Riley hasn\u2019t become a breakout star and to mock Chris Colfer for keeping a shrine to Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThose aren\u2019t even the horror stories. Three cast deaths have been highly sensationalized in the media, and in public discussion of Glee's legacy. In 2013, mere weeks before filming was set to start on the show's fifth season, Glee star Cory Monteith died of mixed drug toxicity involving heroin and alcohol. He\u2019d struggled with substance abuse since his early teens. In 2015, Mark Salling was arrested for possession of child sexual abuse images. He pled guilty and died by suicide in 2018, before he was set to be sentenced. Then there\u2019s Naya Rivera. In 2020, Rivera's then-four-year-old son Josey was found alone on a boat. Police mounted a search and found Rivera\u2019s body. She had drowned. Josey told investigators he and his mom had been swimming; she\u2019d helped him onto the boat, but hadn't been able to pull herself to safety. In 2022, Rivera\u2019s ex-husband Ryan Dorsey settled a wrongful death lawsuit with Ventura County.\n\nThose are three very different stories of death \u2014 three separate people, in wildly distinct scenarios. The Price of Glee doesn\u2019t care that all that ties these deaths together is that the deceased used to work together.\u00a0\n\nThe series does provides brief but valuable insight into the backbreaking work that goes into shows like Glee \u2014\u00a0the kind 60,000 members of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) union authorized a strike over in 2021. Former Glee gaffer J.A. Byerly appears in the docuseries, recalling frequent 70-hour weeks. Byerly\u2019s brother, unnamed in the series, was a fellow crew member who died by suicide at the beginning of Season 6. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I blamed on that show,\u201d Byerly says in the docuseries. But this is not a series about ethical labor practices. Instead, The Price of Glee revels in celebrity even as it pretends to lament its costs. The second episode, which highlights several crew members who died during Glee\u2019s run, spends more time talking about Michele\u2019s alleged attitude on set than about the worker conditions the show claims resulted in the crew member deaths. This is a series that cares, above all, about celebrity gossip. By nature of its framing, The Price of Glee places the deaths of three cast members \u2014\u00a0two of which happened after the show ended \u2014\u00a0above those of below-the-line workers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHonoree Ryan Murphy accepts the Carol Burnett Award at the 80th Annual Golden Globe Awards on January 10, 2023 in Beverly Hills.\u00a0\n\nDespite those priorities, the series is notably lacking interviews with creator Ryan Murphy, any other major producers, or any members of the cast. The series features interviews with Glee's former director of photography, hair department head, set decorator, art director, and location manager \u2014\u00a0roles that, while crucial to the production of a television show, hardly have authority over what happened when the stars went home. The series does include extensive interviews with Rivera's father, George Rivera, as well as three allegedly close friends of Monteith\u2019s: former roommate Justin Neill, actor Stephen Kramer Glickman, and friend from Vancouver Frederic Robinson. But the closest it gets to cast interviews is a former backup dancer and a few stand-ins.\u00a0\n\nCast members Chord Overstreet and Becca Tobin have spoken out against the docuseries, expressing doubts that anyone in the core cast would be involved. In a joint interview with BuzzFeed in November 2022, former cast member Jenna Ushkowitz \u2014 who cohosts a podcast called And That\u2019s What You REALLY Missed with fellow Glee alum Kevin McHale \u2014 expressed her concerns about the documentary: \u201cIn terms of the Discovery+ documentary, it feels even more important, to me at least, to do the podcast because we were the ones who were there. And we were the ones experiencing this. And we know what really happened.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe series\u2019 approach to the misfortunes of the cast is frequently dehumanizing. In The Price of Glee\u2019s first episode, every interview waxes philosophical on the cast\u2019s disorienting launch to notoriety. They talk about Journey and the audition process. These recollections would be benign, boring even \u2014 if it weren\u2019t for the surrealist true crime score dun-dun-dunning in the background. \u201cBy 2020, all of [this cast] would be famous,\u201d text on the screen tells viewers, \u201cand three would be dead.\u201d\n\nUnlike in Glee itself, these moments of camp offer no hint of irony. A montage of highlighted headlines, tweets, and photos plays as if to illustrate the central thesis that yes, of course this show and its cast are cursed. The montage references former cast member Melissa Benoist\u2019s 2019 accusation of domestic abuse against her ex-husband and former Glee co-star Blake Jenner. (In 2020, Jenner released a statement taking \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the hurt he inflicted on Benoist, \u201cemotionally, mentally and yes, physically.\u201d)\u00a0\n\nBut Glee is not a true crime story. The Price of Glee tries to carve grand mythology from the lives of over a dozen actors who once shared small talk over craft services. Along the way, it often forgets these people are human.\u00a0\n\nBenoist met a man at work, he became her husband, and he made the choice to hurt her. It doesn\u2019t really make sense to lump domestic abuse charges with the deaths of former co-workers or to to place Rivera\u2019s or Monteith\u2019s names next to that of a man who died during a legal battle over child sexual abuse images. The series\u2019 connections are tenuous at best, voyeuristic and harmful at worst.\u00a0\n\nGlee was camp: gaudy and a bit of an oddity, amusing and with a confusing relationship to self-awareness. That sensibility has long since shaped how the show is discussed. In the public imagination, tales of what went on behind the scenes at Glee feel like natural extensions of the show\u2019s own fun-house mirror portrayal of the world.\u00a0\n\nBut the cast of Glee were just a group of coworkers. They worked together on a very specific \u2014\u00a0and specifically intense \u2014\u00a0TV show. They put in long hours, chatted with gaffers and grips. They fought, they fucked. They faced challenges that most of us can\u2019t relate to (dodging stalking paparazzi) and ones we can (microaggressions from type-A coworkers). Then their job ended. They moved on. Some left the industry. Life happened.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s probably a lot that\u2019s interesting about Glee\u2019s alumni \u2014\u00a0experiences we haven\u2019t heard, hilarities and tragedies not yet unearthed. Key to any narrative, though, is that people are what make a story interesting. The Price of Glee isn\u2019t interested in that. The show mines lazy hot takes from tragedy. It\u2019s a slap in the face to human beings it exploits. And to a lesser extent, it\u2019s also an insult to those who watched at home. Those who take an interest in how people navigate the extraordinary setting of Hollywood.\u00a0\n\nThe stories we tell bear weight. No one \u2014\u00a0at least not yet \u2014\u00a0has grasped how best to tell the story of what came from Glee.\u00a0\u25cf\n\n",

Bill Lee answers questions at the Republican Governors Association conference on Nov. 15, 2022, in Orlando.\n\nTennessee became the first state on Thursday to enact a drag ban, barring performances from the public eye or where there are minors present.\n\nRepublican Gov. Bill Lee signed HB 9 into law just days after a high school yearbook photo surfaced of him appearing in drag \u2014 in a wig and cheerleader skirt \u2014 as part of a powderpuff football game. He has not confirmed or denied his appearance in the photo.\n\nTennessee law now bans \u201cmale or female impersonators who provide entertainment that appeals to a prurient interest\u201d from performing in public spaces or in front of minors.\u00a0\n\nThe ban is set to go into effect April 1 this year, a few months ahead of Pride festivities, trans advocates have noted. Though it is unclear how the law will be enforced, it does carry criminal penalties for those who violate it.\u00a0\n\nIn 15 states across the country, state legislatures are considering more than 20 bills that target drag performances.\u00a0\n\nThe ACLU noted that the ban violates First Amendment protections. Stella Yarbrough, the ACLU of Tennessee's legal director said in a statement that \"the law bans obscene performances, and drag perforamnces are not inherently obscene.\"\n\n\"However, we are concerned that government officials could easily abuse this law to censor people based on their own subjective viewpoints of what they deem appropriate,\" she said.\n\nA drag performance during Nashville Pride on June 25, 2022\n\nOn Thursday, Lee also signed SB 1 into law, which restricts access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth. Tennessee is the eighth state to ban such care in the US.\n\nThe ban on gender-affirming care will go into effect on July 1, and those already receiving medical care such as puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy will lose this care after March 31, 2024.\u00a0\n\nThe ACLU and Lambda Legal issued another statement promising legal action against Tennessee for the healthcare ban, citing injunctions by federal courts on similar restrictions in Alabama and Arkansas.\n\n\u201cCertain politicians and Gov. Lee have made no secret of their intentions to discriminate against youth who are transgender or their willful ignorance about the life-saving health care they seek to ban,\u201d a joint statement from the organizations said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cInstead, they\u2019ve chosen fearmongering, misrepresentations, intimidation, and extremist politics over the rights of families and the lives of transgender youth in Tennessee. We are dedicated to overturning this unconstitutional law and are confident the state will find itself completely incapable of defending it in court,\u201d it continued.\u00a0\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

Infinity,\u201d another said.\n\nOthers have had sympathy for the influencer, relating to having to tone down their accents in professional settings. \u201cWe need to start seeing these influencers as entertainers, almost actresses and actors because at this point with their millions of followers this has become their job,\u201d TikToker Rachel Leigh said.\n\nNogueira, who is from rural Massachusetts, has addressed her thick accent in the past. In a TikTok livestream from the start of March, Nogueira said she has been mocked for her voice for her \u201centire life.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a fucking Boston accent, I\u2019ve already said that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking redneck accent from where I\u2019m from.\u201d\n\nNogueira did not respond to BuzzFeed News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nHer accent is the latest in a slew of controversies for the 22-year-old. At the start of the year, the beauty influencer was called out for possibly using fake eyelashes to promote a mascara on TikTok.\u00a0\n\nSoon after, followers accused Nogueira of using TikTok\u2019s built-in skin smoothing filter during a paid review of a YSL foundation. \u201cHow can I see if it works if I can\u2019t even see her pores to begin with?!?!? Her nostrils were gone,\u201d one wrote on Reddit. \u201cThat is why I just don't believe most \u2018reviews\u2019 anywhere,\u201d another said.\n\nThe alleged filter also caused fans to question the validity of her other reviews. Under a paid advertisement for a different foundation in January, fans shared their suspicions about her positive takeaways. \u201cIs this real or another trick like the lashes,\u201d one said. \u201cI bought this product based off your review and it definitely DOES NOT offer that much coverage,\u201d another wrote.\n\nEarlier this month, fans also noticed that she seemed to change her review of an eyebrow gel. At the beginning of the month, Nogueira posted a video titled \u201cProducts I Absolutely Regret Buying.\u201d She starts her makeup routine with Got2b\u2019s eyebrow gel, and says that she likes the product but criticizes some aspects of it. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a little hard to get it off,\u201d she says in the video.\u00a0\n\nUsers pointed out that she had done a paid review for the same product on Sept. 22, 2022, in which she spoke glowingly about it. \u201cin my opinion\u2026 best my brows have ever looked. Period,\u201d she captioned her initial sponsored post.\n\nCan someone change their mind about a product review? #mikaylanogueira #mikaylanogueiradrama #beautydrama #deinfluencing #deinfluence #browgel #productreviews #beautyinfluencer \n\nConfusion ensued in the comments. \u201cI cant tell if ur being sarcastic or not,\u201d one wrote to the creator. \u201cWhy did you said you LOVE the brow glue at the paid review?\u201d another said.\n\nNoguiera addressed some of the skepticism in her replies. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I loved it!\u201d Nogueira wrote in response to one fan\u2019s confusion. \u201cIt works really well like I said here, but I just don\u2019t need that much hold on my brows!\u201d\n\nAs criticisms pile up against Nogueria, TikTok users have pointed out influencer Bretman Rock\u2019s recent revealing comments in an interview with Them that \u201cwhite people ruined the beauty community.\u201d\n\nMany fans compared Rock\u2019s words to the ongoing scrutiny around Nogueira\u2019s channel. \u201cMikayla girl\ud83d\ude29 hes talking to you,\u201d one said. But Rock denied that.\n\n\u201cBretman was not referencing Mikayla and he has no comments to contribute regarding her career,\u201d a representative told BuzzFeed News.\n\nSome fans have continued to defend the influencer\u2019s actions. \u201call of yous would do the same thing its money bro,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cid do it too for money,\u201d another said.\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\nSteffi Cao is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.\n\nContact Steffi Cao at steffi.cao@buzzfeed.com.\n\nGot a confidential tip? \ud83d\udc49 Submit it here\n\n",

        "article": "# Even Fitness Influencers Are Fed Up With The Amount Of Lies, Photo Editing, And Manipulation That Go Into Fitspo Social Media Posts\n\nA slightly bigger bicep, a more cinched waist \u2014 a huge amount of fitness influencers are editing their posts, and it's screwing everyone over.\n\nThe quickest way to tell if a fitness influencer has edited their body in a video is to look at the background. Curvy poles and warped windows are dead giveaways. Other times you\u2019ll find crooked shadows in photos or a filter momentarily disappearing from the video.\u00a0\n\nJohn Dorsey, known online as \u201cGoob\u201d or \u201cyour favorite influencer\u2019s least favorite influencer,\u201d is an expert at spotting these blatant \u2014 and subtler \u2014 manipulations. In one video, he argues to his 70,000 Instagram followers that Chinese fitness influencer Jessica Shen seems to be using a waist-cinching filter in a post about a bodybuilding contest that she won.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I understand this. \u2026 You won,\u201d Dorsey says in the video. \u201cYou beat everybody. You got this video after beating everybody, then said, \u2018Let me make my waist even tighter.\u2019 Why?\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe 32-year-old bodybuilding coach has gained notoriety by calling out bad behavior in the fitness industry online, ranging broadly from revealing the criminal background of an influential member of the powerlifting community to alleging that a fitness microinfluencer faked cancer to exposing edited photos. Dorsey\u2019s account has been taken down for alleged community guideline violations 12 times, which he attributes to fitness influencers and their fans fighting back.\u00a0\n\nDorsey is not alone in calling out edited posts. Dozens of communities exist on Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit dedicated to spotting inconsistencies and edited images posted by image-obsessed influencers. BuzzFeed News interviewed eight fitness influencers popular on TikTok and Instagram, and they all acknowledged that editing and filters is an open secret among the industry and that almost everyone does in some capacity \u2014 although, of course, all of them vehemently denied doing it themselves.\n\nThe tweaks are often subtle, they said \u2014\u00a0a slightly bigger bicep for men and a more cinched waist for women. Often, they\u2019ll see someone has edited their photos with adjustments to the hips and butts to achieve a look that\u2019s attainable, if unrealistic. Technology has progressed to the point that it takes mere seconds to edit a photo with apps like CapCut, BodyTuneEditor, Facetune, and FaceApp. Videos and livestreams, which previously served as proof of authentic bodies, can easily be edited as well.\n\nOlivia Marcarelli, a 25-year-old fitness influencer with 400,000 TikTok followers and 150,000 YouTube subscribers, said that most of what she sees other creators post on social media is \u201ctoxic and unrealistic.\u201d Her posts show off her \u201cfit thick\u201d physique and booty-focused exercises, but she said she\u2019s recently become disillusioned with other fitness creators because their posts are so frequently edited.\n\n\u201cGirls literally get famous because of Photoshop. They create a whole identity around their fake bodies,\u201d she said. \u201cJust today, I saw one with 2 million followers of men who think she\u2019s real, but it's so obvious. She edits everything.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMarcarelli didn\u2019t want to call anyone out by name for manipulating their photos;\u00a0she\u2019d rather keep things positive. But Dorsey, who attended law school, has no problem calling people out for false advertising. After revealing that a major influencer had been posting edited photos, he received messages from his audience thanking him for helping them realize why they couldn\u2019t achieve that level of perfection \u2014\u00a0the results are a fabrication.\n\nChristian Shaboo takes a selfie before being photographed at BuzzFeed's New York City offices on Feb. 1, 2023.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s human nature to compare yourself to others, and it\u2019s a relief to find out that someone who looks perfect was all smoke and mirrors,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter I expose a popular influencer, people DM me and tell me that they\u2019re the same height and weight as them and that they could never understand why they don\u2019t look like that.\u201d\n\nSubtle tweaks to an arm or a butt might be obvious to other fitness influencers and seasoned online sleuths, but usually their enormous audiences of millions on YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram aren\u2019t aware of the extent of digital manipulation. There\u2019s a push and pull on both sides. Followers of these fitspo accounts are immersing themselves in unrealistic and often unattainable images, and creators feel pressured to alter their posts to achieve the perfection favored by algorithms.\u00a0\n\nAs a result, people often equate a \u201cperfect\u201d body with someone who can actually give fitness advice. Influencers feed off this, selling exercise plans or simply using their large followings to hawk products such as protein powder and athleisure. And fitness creators in turn have become celebrities with millions of followers. And now there is an entire thriving subculture of creators within the $100 billion fitness industry that is rife with misinformation, misleading images, and influencers with little to no training experience.\u00a0\n\nLawrence Obioma knew that having a muscular physique would help him get a social media following. The 26-year-old tech consultant, who has 480,000 TikTok followers, first went viral for working out while solving a Rubik\u2019s Cube one-handed. He told BuzzFeed News that as his audience grew, people started asking for his workout regimen. Just by looking like the ideal version of a fitness influencer, he became one. He has posted videos of himself lifting weights, but he\u2019s open about the fact that he doesn\u2019t hold any formal certification.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t release my workout plans for monetary gain,\u201d he said, though they\u2019re still available for $10 to $12 on his website. \u201cI did it because people wouldn\u2019t stop asking me for them.\u201d\u00a0\n\nObioma said he hasn\u2019t felt the pressure to edit or alter his videos because he looks \u201cthe same or better in real life,\u201d though in 2020 he posted a series of videos questioning whether influencers were \u201cnatty\u201d (not using steroids) or editing their posts, which he says is a huge problem in the industry. Obioma no longer identifies as a fitness influencer, because he\u2019d rather focus on his comedic content. He now shares videos with dating advice and claims to have more than 100,000 matches on Tinder.\n\nBut his story embodies the conceit for the entire influencer industry. Creators sell their audience something aspirational \u2014 be it outfits, vacations, or perfectly ripped bodies \u2014\u00a0and people pay them with likes and follows. And that does result in actual money, whether it\u2019s from brand deals, merchandise, or TikTok\u2019s Creator Fund. Looking hot and fit is key because research states that people are more likely to trust someone they deem attractive.\u00a0\n\nStill, having a clich\u00e9d #fitspo body online doesn\u2019t mean you have health or fitness knowledge. Claudia Elizabeth, a 23-year-old bodybuilder and certified personal trainer with 250,000 TikTok followers who doesn\u2019t share her last name online for privacy reasons, said she has noticed that some people can\u2019t tell the difference between someone who gives good advice and someone who has a good body.\n\nOn her page, the self-described \u201cmuscle mommy\u201d doesn\u2019t really share advice. She posts videos of herself working out or flexing, but never suggests that other people copy her. She privately works with a coach who makes plans personally for her, and she doesn\u2019t want anyone to interpret what she does as a professional athlete as advice that will work for them.\n\n\u201cStuff like \u2018what I eat in a day\u2019 videos can give people meal ideas, but I don\u2019t recommend people do things to look like me,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned from my work as a trainer that everything needs to be individualized.\u201d\n\nBut even certified instructors feel the pressure to present the best possible version of themselves to gain followers. Elizabeth doesn\u2019t edit her body in photos, but sometimes she feels self-conscious about her posts and knows how to pose to shift the focus on her body to create content the algorithm will love. She rarely faces the camera directly and instead shifts her hips to accentuate her waist and butt.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware of what the fitness community wants to see and what will get me on the Instagram Explore page,\u201d she said. \u201cAn authentic photo isn\u2019t going to get the same amount of likes, but it is important.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAs a fitness influencer, your body is your brand. The better you look, the more likely you are to gain the attention of the algorithm, which translates to followers, which attract money from companies, which can then use your body to advertise a product. When digitally altered photos become commonplace on social media, societal expectations change, and even non-influencers feel the desire to edit themselves to perfection.\n\nAlicia Stern makes some adjustments to her hair at BuzzFeed's New York City offices on Feb. 1, 2023.\n\nA 2019 Mental Health Foundation study found that 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 10 boys ages 13 to 19 have edited their images due to poor body image. A separate study conducted at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 found that 90% of women would edit their faces or waists before sharing their photos online.\u00a0\n\nImage manipulation contributes to body dissatisfaction by normalizing unrealistic ideals, even if it is a tiny cinching of the waist. Dorsey said that going offline to avoid this kind of pressure just isn\u2019t sustainable for most people. What\u2019s posted online has become our reality because we\u2019re constantly immersed in it.\n\n\u201cPeople forget what kind of effect the internet can have on their perception when it\u2019s in their face all day,\u201d he said. \u201cThen they see the receipts that something has been edited, and they realize it\u2019s not actually reality.\u201d\n\nHe said influencers will continue editing themselves as long as they can get away with it, and he can\u2019t catch everyone. There\u2019s no quick fix for such a deeply rooted societal problem, but body-focused influencers can have a real impact on their followers.\n\nPsychologist Holly Schiff told BuzzFeed News that exposure to inauthentic fitness photos creates impossible standards that can result in lower self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThese feelings can cause people to engage in unhealthy behaviors that they think will help them attain these physiques they are seeing in manipulated photos,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\nNicole Axelson, 26, started documenting her \u201cfitness journey\u201d when she was a teenager. She shared all the typical things a fitness influencer would, like her workouts and what she eats in a day, treating Instagram like a public diary. It all changed in her early 20s when she realized that the passion for exercise she was feeling wasn\u2019t determination, it was self-hatred. She decided she didn\u2019t want to perpetuate that to her followers.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want them to feel like if they wanted to look like me, they had to track their food and go to the gym or buy a $60 supplement,\u201d Axelson said. \u201cI was actually very miserable while I was doing a lot of those things.\u201d\n\nAxelson stepped away from fitness influencing in 2020 to post about other aspects of her life and started a line of exercise gear with inclusive sizing. The Colorado resident said she is now in recovery from an eating disorder; though she still follows fitness influencers, she\u2019d rather focus on ones that celebrate empowerment rather than looking a certain way. The problem with the industry, to Axelson, is not necessarily other fitness influencers \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s anti-fat discrimination.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI wish more influential creators would talk about their bodies in ways that aren\u2019t just aesthetic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means a lot to me to be honest in promoting my story.\u201d\u00a0\n\nTaurean Parker checks himself out via his iPhone camera at BuzzFeed's New York City offices on Feb. 1, 2023.\n\nAnd that honesty translates into followers too. Caleb Marshall, a 29-year-old from Indiana who has more than 1 million followers on Facebook and TikTok, said he started posting workouts online in 2014 after working as a certified group fitness instructor teaching dance classes. Over nearly 10 years, trends have come and gone, but he has remained relentlessly spirited and goofy in his videos of pop-centric dance workout routines.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking perfect, you\u2019ll get a following for looking perfect, and that will be your thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut being pretty and perfect is not something that necessarily has longevity.\u201d\n\nMany of the most popular \u201cauthentic\u201d fitness influencers who post unflattering angles, cellulite, and tummy rolls are still image-focused and aspirational enough to draw in followers in the first place. In fact, there\u2019s now an entire genre of social media post that leads thin influencers to reveal that they look bigger in some angles than others, which has been criticized for implying that it\u2019s bad to look fat.\n\nWhile many influencers tweak their bodies with editing software that is accessible, easy to use, and cheap, others are going more extreme. Some fitness influencers have gotten plastic surgery (like Tammy Hembrow\u2019s breast augmentation) or use steroids (like the Liver King) to achieve an ideal look, but that yields more drastic results with potentially deadly side effects.\n\nMarcarelli said that while she has felt pressured to edit her photos, she hasn\u2019t given in. Like Obioma, she became a creator when her friends started encouraging her to share her workouts after noticing how her physique changed with frequent exercise. She quickly gained a lot of followers (many of them men) as what she called a \u201cbooty influencer\u201d \u2014 literally women with strong, perky butts of pure muscle.\n\n\u201cI took a step back in 2022 when I realized how oversexualized it all was,\u201d Marcarelli said. She started ignoring comments from her mostly male followers and unfollowing women who seemed to be posting for men\u2019s attention.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI would rather my community be a bunch of girls that I could chat with and help out. That\u2019s what gives me a purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cI recommend doing a big unfollowing spree. If I\u2019m not helping, unfollow me too.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, Marshall said he doesn\u2019t feel the need to edit any of his images \u2014 he gets the most views when he is his unedited self.\u00a0Some of his top videos involve him messing up a dance routine, or sweating profusely.\n\nUnlike Elizabeth, Obioma and Marcarelli do not have any fitness training certification. Obioma has effectively left the industry, and Marcarelli said she\u2019s learned enough from professionals in person and online that she feels comfortable selling workout plans for $30 to $45 per PDF with the caveat that her advice is just what works for her. That\u2019s a lot cheaper for her followers than hiring a personal trainer.\u00a0\n\nThough online workouts make fitness more affordable and accessible to a wider audience, the best way to get top-quality advice is not from a stranger online \u2014\u00a0at least that\u2019s what offline experts say. Putting your trust in someone without official training can be \u201cincredibly dangerous,\u201d certified personal trainer James Dixon told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\u201cIt can make a person incredibly insecure about their body, which can lead them to lean on unhealthy workout routines and diet plans,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\nThere are a number of certifications that fitness professionals can obtain, like CPT (certified personal trainer), CNC (certified nutritional coach), NASM (a course from the National Academy of Sports Medicine), and so on. Depending on the program, it costs roughly $500 to $5,000 to gain access to classes that can last between 4 and 15 weeks. Sometimes, creators list their certifications in an alphabet soup of initials in their bios, which fitness influencer watchdog Dorsey said is a red flag.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of fitness certifications are predatory because they rely on people thinking they need them to work at a gym when they don\u2019t in most states,\u201d he said. \u201cI coach professional bodybuilders. There\u2019s no certification that says, I\u2019m good to help people get jacked and tan.\u201d He clarified that he\u2019s not giving any kind of medical advice \u2014\u00a0you shouldn\u2019t come to him for weight loss guidance or tips to get started on your fitness journey, and you won\u2019t find any on his Instagram either.\u00a0\n\nJaedon Mitchell, a certified personal trainer and nutrition coach, said that the power most fitness creators have over their audience has inspired a rise of unqualified influencers, which is \u201cthe worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to the fitness industry.\u201d\n\nHe said that one day at the gym, he saw a new member hanging upside down from a pull-up bar doing the \u201cmost absurd\u201d exercise he\u2019d ever seen, which could also result in serious physical injury. The gymgoer told Mitchell that he had seen on social media that the exercise could help with core strength. When Mitchell found the post online, he found that dozens of young people were excitedly commenting that they wanted to try it, too. The creator who shared the pull-up exercise had no official training at all.\n\n\u201cIt was as if the influencer was the leader of a cult, creating these bizarre exercises on his own, and his followers believed everything without question,\u201d he said. \u201cNot all influencers without credentials are giving bad advice, but would you trust someone to do surgery on you if you weren\u2019t sure they were a licensed doctor?\u201d\n\nThough it seems social media algorithms currently favor aesthetics over everything, some extremely successful fitness influencers shift the focus away from what they look like in a way that ex-influencer Axelson said she craved.\u00a0\n\nMarshall said his goal is not to help people look good \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s to help them feel good. Posting like other fitness influencers just doesn\u2019t bring him the same level of joy as being goofy.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with making normal people feel like superstars,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have our moments where we\u2019re not so confident, but when I tried to post like other people, it just wasn\u2019t fun for me.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMarshall added that people were prioritizing their personal goals and emotional well-being during the early stages of the pandemic, which led to a craving for more authentic content like his. To him, the transformation of the fitness industry isn\u2019t just possible. It\u2019s already underway.\n\n\u201cAesthetics will always be something that people chase, but we just found out how bleak the world can be,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cI think the influencers who are focusing on mental and overall wellness are the ones who will succeed.\u201d \u25cf\n\n",

In November, a judge declared a mistrial after jurors said they were deadlocked on all three charges.\n\nProsecutors said they plan to retry Masterson on the same counts. Motion hearings are scheduled for March 6 and March 27. Jury selection in the retrial is set to begin March 29.\n\nAccording to Variety, the jurors had leaned toward acquittal on all three counts, but Mueller argued on Tuesday that the jury had ignored supporting testimony.\n\n\u201cNot giving these victims another chance with a jury who can sit there and consider all of the evidence \u2014 win, lose, or draw \u2014 that would be an injustice,\u201d Mueller said.\n\nDanny Masterson leaves Los Angeles County Superior Court with his wife, Bijou Phillips, after a judge declared a mistrial in his rape case on Nov. 30, 2022.\n\nThe weekslong trial featured graphic testimony from the three women Masterson was charged with raping and a fourth woman who also accused him of sexual assault, as well as extensive discussion about the Church of Scientology.\n\nMasterson, a prominent Scientologist who is best known for playing Steven Hyde on That '70s Show, attempted to keep the church out of the trial. But the institution and its practices took center stage as the three women, who are all former Scientologists, testified about how church officials allegedly tried to shield the actor from accountability.\n\nIn a statement provided to BuzzFeed News on behalf of the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, two of the women and one of their husbands said they were \"completely committed\" to participating and testifying in the next trial against Masterson. The firm is representing the individuals in their civil case against Masterson and the Church of Scientology.\n\n\"We are pleased that Danny Masterson will not be permitted to simply escape criminal accountability,\" they said.\n\nMasterson maintained his innocence throughout the proceedings and claimed that he only had consensual sex with the women. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 45 years to life in prison.\n\nHis attorneys recently filed court papers asking Judge Charlaine Olmedo to dismiss the charges. They argued that the jury in the first trial believed \"there were significant evidentiary and credibility problems\" with the prosecutors' case.\n\n\"And while there was disagreement as to the ultimate vote, on one thing the jurors all appeared to agree \u2014 no reasonable jury was ever going to come to a unanimous finding on guilty on any count,\" Masterson's attorneys wrote.\n\nAccording to multiple news outlets, Olmedo denied the request Tuesday, allowing prosecutors to move forward. Jury selection is set to begin on March 29.\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

I\u2019m too hood. I\u2019m too ghetto. But when other people do it, y\u2019all say nothing.\u201d\n\nA showdown between two college basketball teams has generated a heated debate around sportsmanship \u2014 but also spotlighted a glaring double standard for Black women athletes.\n\nLouisiana State University\u2019s Angel Reese was described as \u201cclassless\u201d by sports fans who took issue with her taunting Iowa star player Caitlin Clark when their two teams faced off for the NCAA women\u2019s basketball tournament on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAll year, I was critiqued about who I was,\u201d Reese said at the postgame press conference. \u201cI don\u2019t fit in a box that y\u2019all want me to be in. I\u2019m too hood. I\u2019m too ghetto. But when other people do it, y\u2019all say nothing.\n\n\"I don\u2019t fit in the box that y\u2019all want me to be in.

It\u2019s unapologetically you,\u201d she added.\u00a0\n\nReese, who transferred to LSU this season, was among the most-talked-about athletes during the tournament.\u00a0\n\nFor the final on Sunday, the 20-year-old from Baltimore served Clark a taste of her own medicine when she mirrored the \u201cyou can\u2019t see me\u201d taunting motion that the Iowa point guard had displayed earlier in the tournament.\u00a0\n\nThis is classless. Angel Reese is only 20, so she\u2019s still young, but taunting Caitlin Clark like this shows a pure lack of class.\nWin with class, lose with class, play with class.\nClark\u2019s mom and dad can be proud that her daughter ignored the taunting. They raised her right.\n\nThe taunt was made popular by WWE superstar John Cena, who also cheered on Clark when she dropped it during a showdown against the Louisville Cardinals.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nReese decided to one-up Clark by gesturing to her index finger and signaling her pending championship ring.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe LSU Tigers defeated the Iowa Hawkeyes 102\u201385 to win their first NCAA tournament title, but a lot of people online seemed more focused on Reese\u2019s conduct.\u00a0\n\nWhat a fucking idiot https://t.co/C8dW0tukfP\n\nBarstool\u2019s Dave Portnoy branded the star player a \u201cclassless piece of shit.\u201d Politics and sports commentator Keith Olbermann called Reese a \u201cfucking idiot,\u201d to which basketball legend Shaq responded, \u201cshut your dumb ass up leave angel reese alone.\u201d\n\nWhat a classless move by Angel Reese. Doing WAY too much to taunt Clark.\n\nReese told reporters at the press conference that the game was \u201cbigger\u201d than her and made sure to highlight the differences in reception. Just days prior, Clark\u2019s \u201cclap backs\u201d were compiled for an ESPN package, celebrating the record-breaking athlete's court quips and trash talk.\u00a0\n\nThe clear double standard prompted the likes of LeBron James, Samuel L. Jackson, and much of Black Twitter to rally in Reese\u2019s defense against raging criticisms she was receiving.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t \u201cclassless\u201d when Caitlin Clark did it, don\u2019t call it classless when Angel Reese does it. Let the women compete, it\u2019s sports!!\n\nHow it started How it\u2019s Going\n\nIf you praised Caitlin Clark as competitive, fiery, and passionate for doing the \u201cYou can\u2019t See me\u201d celebration and are criticizing Angel Reese for the same we already know!!\n\nESPN\u2019s Stephen A. Smith also weighed in with his assessment of the situation after giving praise to Clark but also noting that she had \u201cinstigated\u201d the type of taunting displayed on Sunday.\n\n\u201cAngel Reese has no class. Caitlin Clark was raised right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all know that there's a white/black issue here, because the fact of the matter is when Caitlyn did it, people were celebrating it, and they were talking about nothing but her greatness,\u201d Smith said.\u00a0\n\nBlack Twitter and LSU Twitter joining forces to defend Angel Reese\n#LSU\n\n\u201cBut then the second a sister stepped up and throws it back in her face, now you got half the basketball world saying, \u2018Well, you know what, that's not the classiest thing to do.\u2019 It was the exact same thing.\u201d\n\nDespite the heat, Reese doubled down on social media, posting a photo of herself in action and following up with another tweet, writing, \u201cAnd no I\u2019M NOT KEEPING IT CUTE.\"\n\nTelling players like Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark to turn down their emotional fire is like telling a lion not to roar. \n\nIt's who they are and it's part of their game. Their competitiveness on the court is infectious, not only for teammates but also the crowd. I love it.\n\nReese was named the 2023 Most Outstanding Player in the NCAA women\u2019s tournament.\n\n## More internet culture\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# \"Daisy Jones & The Six\" Is A TV Show Now And Unfortunately It's Boring\n\nAmazon Prime\u2019s adaptation of the 2019 Taylor Jenkins-Reid novel is a predictable melodrama that pales in comparison to the history it rips off. (Warning: contains spoilers.)\n\nThe problem with making a TV show inspired by Fleetwood Mac is that if the fictional band is less interesting than the real deal, the whole project starts to seem pointless. Why mythologize a fake band when the history of the real one is richer and more epic?\u00a0\n\nThis is the shadow that haunts Daisy Jones & the Six, Amazon Prime\u2019s adaptation of the 2019 Taylor Jenkins-Reid novel of the same name, which premieres this Friday. The show chronicles the rise and fall of a rock band \u2014\u00a0also called Daisy Jones & the Six \u2014 based in Laurel Canyon in the 1970s. The members struggle with drug addiction and internal drama, but from this emotional maelstrom, they produce a beloved album, embark on a sold-out tour, and become \u201cthe most famous band in the world.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s basically the story of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s 1977 album Rumours, which they created during the turbulence of a triple breakup afflicting all five members of the band, four of whom were in relationships with one another. But in the story of Daisy Jones & the Six, only two people really matter: lead singers Billy Dunne (Sam Claflin) and Daisy Jones (Riley Keough). They write most of the songs, do most of the drugs, and fuel most of the drama. The rest of the Six is decorative. There are a couple of toothless subplots: Bassist Eddie (Josh Whitehouse) is perpetually bitter about Billy\u2019s success, and keyboardist Karen (Suki Waterhouse) and guitarist Graham (Will Harrison) fall secretly in love. But the show revolves around Billy and Daisy\u2019s wearisome love-hate, will-they-or-won\u2019t-they dynamic. They are twin artistic souls, but they can\u2019t be together because of Billy\u2019s wife Camila (Camila Morrone). They understand each other the way nobody else can, but they also resent each other for it.\n\nOr so the show tells us. The mockumentary format, which mimics the novel\u2019s structure as an oral history, is a reliable storytelling crutch. In confessionals, the former members of the band, now middle-aged, dutifully explain what was important about the previous scene, or what will be important about the next. When Billy and Daisy write a song together for the first time, Karen reports, \u201cI remember having this feeling like nothing would ever be the same again. It was obvious that they made each other better\u2026until, of course, they didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThis melodrama is consistent with the tone of the novel, which declares in the first two pages, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get much more obviously broken and more classically beautiful than Daisy Jones.\u201d In trying to raise the stakes of this fictional band, both the book and the show make a lot of grandiose claims about how compelling the characters are. But this self-reflexive hype feels increasingly empty as the story fails to live up to its own projections.\n\nFor supposedly star-crossed lovers, Billy and Daisy have very little chemistry. There are a few genuinely erotic moments in the show, like when Billy and Daisy fight from 3 inches apart, glaring at each other with barely tethered self-restraint. But most of the time, they seem rote and disconnected, two lukewarm bodies that happen to be in the same room. And for world-class rockers, they deliver cringingly stiff performances.\u00a0\n\nThe actual songs are, thankfully, not bad. \u201cLook at Us Now (Honeycomb)\u201d might even be catchy. Keough is clearly a gifted vocalist, and her throaty alto has a warm, almost Southern twang that carries echoes of her grandfather, Elvis Presley. If the songs can sometimes be obvious \u2014\u00a0the lyrics \u201cYou regret me and I regret you\u201d stand out as uninspired \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s at least fair to remember that Fleetwood Mac could be corny too. But Daisy Jones & the Six\u2019s utter lack of stage presence sucks the air out of the music. Billy, who early in the show is compared to Mick Jagger for his vivid, undeniable star power, rarely does anything more interesting onstage than sticking his tongue out \u2014\u00a0although, once, in a state of heightened emotion, he plays his guitar vertically. Their costumes are lackluster, too. Billy typically resembles a mannequin displaying Uniqlo\u2019s business casual basics, while Daisy always looks like she\u2019s recreating a Coachella Pinterest board on a college student\u2019s budget. She has the gaping bell sleeves of a classic Stevie Nicks look, but none of the unruly textures or layers; her gauzy robes are a poor imitation of Nicks\u2019 kitschy, witchy flair.\u00a0\n\nAs for Billy and Daisy\u2019s romance, it\u2019s a shame that the story never leans fully into the spectacle of them getting together. Billy spends the whole series pouting that he loves his wife, while Daisy spends it denying that she loves Billy. This shared emotional constipation is supposed to be the root of their transcendent connection, but it feels less like a love story than an adolescent spat. At least the Fleetwood Mac folks had affairs and got divorced! Billy and Daisy kiss exactly two times, and the second time, Billy only does it because he thinks Camila has already left him. Then Daisy tells him to go get her back.\n\nFor a story about rock musicians living at the height of hedonism, Daisy Jones & the Six is bizarrely prudish and pro-monogamy. Billy redeems himself by choosing Camila over Daisy at the climax of the final episode, but their marriage has already atrophied so much, after years of Billy pining after Daisy, that it seems pointless to reunite them. Why not let Billy and Daisy have their pent-up sex and force all the characters to reckon with a more complicated grief? Why make Camila the long-suffering saint and perpetual cuckold when she could be something more interesting?\n\nOne reason the show is so preoccupied with Camila\u2019s goodness is that the documentary turns out to be the project of Julia Dunne, Billy and Camila\u2019s daughter. After Camila\u2019s death from a terminal illness, presumably cancer, Julia is trying to understand her mother\u2019s life through the story of her father\u2019s career; the show\u2019s sentimentality flows from Julia\u2019s perspective. But Camila is also the foil who reifies the deep appeal of being Daisy Jones. Camila is so good she\u2019s boring, while Daisy is the messy starlet, beautiful and broken, irresistible despite her many flaws. By the end of the show, Daisy wins it all. Not only is she a rich, famous, successful artist, and not only is she still alive, but Camila\u2019s dying wish is for Billy to \u201cgive Daisy Jones a call.\u201d After everything, Daisy even gets the guy.\n\nDaisy is excruciatingly self-victimizing and, in her own best friend\u2019s words, \u201ca real selfish bitch.\u201d She is a classically clueless, over-privileged white woman, one who grows up filthy rich and stunningly beautiful, but who still believes she deserves everyone\u2019s sympathy because she\u2019s lonely and self-destructive. The rest of the characters in Daisy Jones & the Six believe this too, and by virtue of this collective fantasy, Daisy Jones becomes the story\u2019s role model: a woman who can be as cruel and narcissistic as she wants with total impunity because she\u2019s gorgeous and gifted enough that everyone will adore her anyway.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s annoying, but it is completely consistent with the rest of the show\u2019s perspective: that bloated self-importance makes up for a fundamental blandness of plot or personality. Daisy Jones & the Six is relentlessly impressed with itself, but under all its swagger is a predictable melodrama that pales in comparison to the history it rips off.\u00a0\u25cf\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# \u201cI Don\u2019t Think He Thinks He Deserves Love\u201d: \u201cTed Lasso\u201d Stars Brett Goldstein And Juno Temple Explained Their Heartbreaking Storyline\n\nThe two stars opened up on why their characters couldn\u2019t make their relationship last. (Warning: contains spoilers for episodes 1 and 2 of Season 3.)\n\nIs lasting love even real anymore? According to Ted Lasso, it might not be.\n\nThe love story between agitated retired football star Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein) and bubbly publicist Keeley Jones (Juno Temple), which dominated the first two seasons of the Emmy-winning series, had fans fawning over the pair's chemistry. However, Season 3, which premiered on March 15, did away with all the relationship goodwill as Roy and Keeley ended their multi-season relationship.\u00a0\n\nOf course, this came as a surprise to Ted (Jason Sudeikis) and the rest of the AFC Richmond team. Viewers too.\n\n\u201cI don't think he thinks he deserves love or he deserves someone like Keeley,\u201d Goldstein told BuzzFeed News of Roy.\u00a0\n\nThough known for its whimsical dad jokes, overly motivational tones, and soccer backdrop, Ted Lasso at its core is a show about the trials of everyday hardships like workplace insecurity, panic attacks, and, most commonly, the end of relationships. Roy and Keeley\u2019s relationship was often a barometer for the show\u2019s larger storylines.\n\nKeeley\u2019s cheerful attitude brought out the best in everyone, especially grumpy Roy. Before he began dating her in Season 1, he was often angry and annoyed. Meanwhile, he showed her unconditional respect and admiration unlike her previous partner Jamie (Phil Dunster).\n\nWhile their personality differences brought them together and helped them thrive, it\u2019s their similarities that ultimately drew them apart. The start of Season 3 saw Keeley reshape her career from being a model and influencer to running her own PR firm, while Roy is hard-set on coaching the Richmond team to success and beating rival team West Ham.\n\n\u201cPeople say that when your personal life is going well, normally, your work life suffers, and vice versa,\u201d Temple told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIt feels heartbreaking and complicated, but, at the same time, she has to focus on this other thing too and so does he.\u201d\n\nIn Episode 2 of Season 3, Roy tells Ted and Trent Crimm (James Lance) that part of him regrets leaving the Chelsea team, where he became a star player before joining AFC Richmond years later, because he was scared he would eventually fail miserably at football, a clear metaphor for his relationship with Keeley.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat I understand about Roy is that he was this man who repressed his feelings for his entire life. Then he falls in love with Keeley, and she cracks him open. All these feelings come forward, but he has no way of managing them,\u201d Goldstein said, calling Roy \u201cself-destructive\u201d in his self-imposed need to protect himself on the field and in his personal relationships. \u201cIt's the first time he's let anything out, and I think he feels panic and shame and a sense of worthlessness.\u201d\n\nUnlike the split between Ted and his wife Michelle (Andrea Anders) or that of Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) and her husband Rupert (Anthony Head), both of which were fueled by one person not feeling as strongly for the other, it\u2019s clear Roy and Keeley still love each other apart as they did together. Of course, this makes their split all the more tragic.\n\n\u201cI think they both really wanted each other to grow and find their own footing,\u201d Temple said. \u201cAnd I think that has also led to complications of them being able to make it work as a couple.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain whether the two will make their way back to each other at the end, but both Goldstein and Temple are excited to see their characters thrive independently.\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

Netflix quickly tweeted that the show would start in 15 minutes, though this wasn\u2019t the case.

We are not asking any questions to anybody until we're streaming live into your living rooms, onto your phones, onto your tablets, [or] whatever you\u2019re watching on.\u201d\n\n\n## \nNeedless to say, Twitter quickly became a gold mine of hilarious memes about the mess, with #LoveIsLate becoming a popular hashtag. In fact, the Love Is Blind cast members themselves even joined in to poke fun at the entire thing \u2014 and Tiffany wound up falling asleep during the wait, just like she memorably did in the pods.\n\n\nI\u2019m trying yall\n\n#LoveIsBlindLIVE https://t.co/CTIGdgSEiX\n\nHow long have you been waiting for the reunion to start? \n\n#LoveIsBlind #LOVEISBLINDreunion\n\nMe because the love is blind live reunion isn\u2019t working #LOVEISBLINDreunion #LoveIsBlind #LoveisBlind4\n\nNetflix is running up on their IT like #loveislate\n\nSCREAMING \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 #LOVEISBLINDreunion #loveislate\n\n## \nWell, after viewers waited for roughly 75 minutes \u2014 and after many had flocked off to watch Succession instead, Netflix issued a statement apologizing for the failed livestream.\n\n\nlove is blind costed me a hour of sleep now \ud83e\udd23 smh\n\n## \n\u201cTo everyone who stayed up late, woke up early, gave up their Sunday afternoon\u2026 we are incredibly sorry that the Love is Blind Live Reunion did not turn out as we had planned,\u201d they tweeted. \u201cWe\u2019re filming it now and we'll have it on Netflix as soon as humanly possible.

Here\u2019s everything you need to know. Warning: spoilers below.\n\n\n## \nFirst things first, Brett and Tiffany are still very happily married! This should come as much-needed joy to LIB fans.\n\n\n## \nThe couple, who easily enjoyed the healthiest relationship this season, are now living together in Portland. Opening up about how grateful they\u2019ve been to grow together in their marriage, Brett and Tiff revealed that they\u2019re taking things slow before they consider having children. Exciting!\n\n\n## \nAs for Chelsea and Kwame, they are also still together!\n\n\n## \nAfter experiencing a little more hesitation and conflict during their journey, Chelsea and Kwame have settled down in Seattle, which is something that they didn\u2019t previously agree on. Fortunately, they seem to be super happy.\n\n\n## \nAs for the whole Micah/Kwame situation \u2014 and that memorably flirtatious chat they had in Mexico under Chelsea\u2019s nose \u2014 the two women have talked through the entire thing. Kwame also apologized profusely to Chelsea and labeled his behavior \"immature.\"\n\n\n## \nThe final couple that got married this season was Zack and Bliss. Much like their wedded peers, they\u2019re also still going strong.\n\n\n## \nThe pair looked super happy, with fans describing their energy as \u201ccouple goals.\u201d Despite how awkward it was when Zack met Bliss\u2019s dad, who didn\u2019t seem too pleased by their relationship, things are completely different today. Not only are he and Zack now \u201cbest buds,\u201d but he\u2019s also funding the couple\u2019s honeymoon trip to Panama.\n\n\nI feel like Bliss and Zack don\u2019t get enough credit for being the classy and aesthetic couple they are. Not to mention the way they always defend each other. True couple goals. #LoveisBlind4 #LoveIsBlindLIVE #LOVEISBLINDreunion https://t.co/ujpAwqeDBe\n\n## \nIn one of the standout moments of the reunion, Zack and Bliss actually confronted Irina over her treatment of him this season.\n\n\n## \nAs mentioned, Zack and Irina broke off their engagement due to their total lack of chemistry. Irina repeatedly drove this home by speaking about how she\u2019d gotten the \u201cick\u201d from him and comparing his looks to that of a \u201ccartoon character.\u201d\n\n\n## \nConfronting her on the reunion, Zack said, \u201cYou did a lot of things that hurt a lot of people, including me. I mean, you only see 10% of it on the camera. There was so much stuff that happened that was just unbelievable.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cIf we're real, you went on this show to get famous,\u201d he said, to which the audience cheered in apparent agreement. \u201cBut look, I forgive you. I genuinely, 100% forgive you, Irina. I really don't hold anything against you. There's so many people that want to attack the people [and] the cast on this show. And you have no idea, like, everybody who made a mistake on this show, it has been punishment enough for the entire world to see them at their worst.\u201d\n\n\n## \nSupporting her husband, Bliss also called out Irina\u2019s behavior on the show, revealing that she\u2019d received a DM from Irina saying that she\u2019d \u201cdodged a bullet\u201d when things didn\u2019t initially work out with Zack.\n\n\n## \nIrina was branded one of the seasons \"mean girls,\" not just because of her treatment of Zack but also due to her \"horrible\" treatment of the other women on the show. In the reunion, she admitted that she\u2019d been \u201cselfish,\u201d though she claimed her \u201cintention was never to hurt anyone.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnother one of the season\u2019s \u201cmean girls,\u201d Micah, was also confronted by Zack during the reunion, and this time it was about Paul.\n\n\n## \nAs mentioned, Paul ended up turning Micah down at the altar on the day of their wedding. She was devastated by his decision at the time, but it turns out that the pair actually starting dating again \u2014 for a short amount of time \u2014 after the wedding drama.\n\n\n## \nAfter Vanessa repeatedly questioned Paul\u2019s decision to say \"no\" to Micah, Zack ended up speaking out on his friend\u2019s behalf. He claimed that he\u2019d heard Micah also had no intention to marry Paul on the day, before accusing her of purposefully trying to make Paul look like a \u201creally bad guy.\u201d\n\n\n## \nFinally, who could forget about Marshall, Jackie, and Josh.\n\n\n## \nIt turns out that Jackie and Josh are still dating, and they\u2019re actually living together!\n\n\n## \nHowever, much to viewers\u2019 dismay, the couple didn\u2019t actually show up to the reunion in person. Instead, they opted to film a prerecorded segment with Vanessa ahead of time.\n\n\nJackie\u2026 Josh, the fact y\u2019all skipped out on the reunion says A LOT. The fact y\u2019all were still given air time via Zoom, is annoying. #LoveIsBlindLIVE #LoveisBlind4 #LoveIsBlind\n\n## \n\u201cWe're taking our time with everything,\u201d Josh said. \u201cLife comes at you fast and we don't want to rush anything... We live together now. We got a dog. We got a fish. I'm a girl dad!\u201d\n\n\n## \nJackie added, \u201cI have grown within the last year. That person that I've seen was a totally different Jackie, to be honest,\u201d seemingly referring to her relentless arguments with Marshall over his lack of \u201caggressive\u201d nature.\n\n\n## \nWhat\u2019s more, Jackie also quickly addressed the misconception that she\u2019d cheated on Marshall with Josh, something that fans believed was the case due to the way LIB had been edited. \u201cOK, so I broke up with Marshall before I saw Josh at the coffee shop. It looks like I\u2019m a cheater and I am not a cheater,\u201d she claimed.\n\n\n## \nViewers were also pretty angry to see Vanessa laughing with Jackie when she addressed the fact that she kept the ring Marshall gave her after breaking up with him.\n\n\n## \nMarshall had previously asked Jackie for the ring back, saying that she shouldn\u2019t have accepted his proposal and that he didn\u2019t think she deserved it. But Jackie maintained that she\u2019d keep it, claiming that she did initially want to marry Marshall and therefore did deserve it. The rings are purchased by the LIB team, not the cast members.\n\n\n## \nGiven this was such a huge source of contention on the show, fans were annoyed to see Vanessa downplay the entire thing and joke with Jackie about the ring. Jackie claimed Marshall wanted it in order to propose to a different pod member, something that he appeared completely baffled by.\n\n\n## \nAll in all, viewers were left unimpressed by the lack of accountability taken by cast members like Jackie, Irina, and Micah during the reunion. Vanessa and Nick were also largely blamed for letting them off the hook and targeting people like Marshall and Paul instead.\n\n\nI think we can collectively agree that Nick and Vanessa are terrible hosts #LOVEISBLINDreunion #LoveisBlind4\n\nThey need to fire Vanessa and Nick immediately. Vanessa is so aggressive to the guys and or the wrong people. Nick doesn\u2019t even talk. This reunion sucked because of the hosts. #LoveIsBlindLIVE\n\nNick and Vanessa Lachey are terrible hosts. She asks all the wrong questions, takes the wrong sides and then goes, \u201ctime to move on\u201d before anyone\u2019s answered a single thing #LOVEISBLINDreunion\n\nMicah and irina sat up there taking no accountability and everybody just ate that shit up (especially mrs vanessa) I\u2019m disappointed In everybody tbh lol because the other cast members should have had the guts to call them out on the BS #LOVEISBLINDreunion\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

Rowling\u2019s Anti-Trans Views As \u201cBullshit\u201d\n\nBut the British journalist who wrote the Judy Blume profile is defending her story.\n\nJudy Blume said Sunday that she \u201cwholly\u201d supports the transgender community after an article in a British newspaper quoted her as saying she was \u201cbehind\u201d J.K. Rowling \u201c100 per cent.\u201d\n\nThe author of the classic children\u2019s novel Are You There God? It\u2019s Me, Margaret was profiled in the Sunday Times newspaper by Hadley Freeman, a journalist who quit the Guardian last year in part because she said that outlet censored her from writing more anti-transgender stories.\n\nFreeman\u2019s profile \u2014 headlined \u201cJudy Blume: \u2018I\u2019m behind JK Rowling 100 per cent\u2019 \u2014 discussed Blume\u2019s career at length but prominently featured her comments about the Harry Potter writer in its opening paragraphs.\n\n\u201cI love her,\u201d Blume was quoted as saying about Rowling. \u201cI am behind her 100 per cent as I watch from afar.\u201d\n\nIn subsequent sentences, Freeman then said Blume was specifically referring to \u201cthe abuse Rowling has received for speaking up in defence of women\u2019s sex-based rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that Blume has faced repeated attacks since the 1980s, for her books\u2019 descriptions of adolescent sexuality and puberty,\u201d Freeman wrote, \u201cshe knows what it\u2019s like to be pilloried as an author.\u201d\n\nFreeman then asked whether Blume had reached out to Rowling, to which Blume said she had only communicated with her a few times previously. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in touch with her during this tough time. Probably I should,\u201d Blume was quoted as saying.\n\nGiven the article\u2019s headline and framing \u2014 and the fact it was behind a paywall that stopped many people from reading more of the story \u2014 many people online were quick to express their disappointment at what they perceived as Blume\u2019s support of anti-trans discrimination.\n\nBut on Sunday afternoon, Blume tweeted a statement in which she said she stands with the transgender community.\n\nBlume said she had been trying to say she could empathize with people who receive harassment online, but that the article\u2019s suggestion that she did not support equality and acceptance for the LGBTQ community was \u201cbullshit.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Blume also pointed to an interview she did with Variety last month in which she railed against banning books to try to prevent children from becoming LGBTQ and in which she praised Maia Kobabe\u2019s memoir Gender Queer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the No. 1 banned book in America right now,\u201d Blume told Variety. \u201cAnd I thought, This young person is telling me how they came to be what they are today. And I learned a lot and became even more empathetic. That\u2019s what books are all about.\u201d\n\nMany LGBTQ people and allies were quick to thank Blume for showing support.\n\n@judyblume Love and admiration to you, Ms. Blume \u2014 it\u2019s ridiculous that your words were so shamelessly exploited as a way to further divide people. Thank you for supporting trans rights.\n\nJudy Blume is the best https://t.co/Te86L4KaQ0\n\nJudy Blume said \u201cAre you there Fuck Around? It\u2019s Me, Find Out.\u201d https://t.co/GenskeHmKC\n\nBut others said she had \u201ccaved\u201d to \u201ccancel culture.\u201d\n\nJudy Blume caved in about 12 hours and put out a struggle session statement. She\u2019s 80 and very successful, you would have thought she wouldn\u2019t care anymore. Just goes to emphasise how brave @jk_rowling is.\n\n\"Are you there, God? It's me, morons.\"\n\nJudy Blume. The cancel culture mob is now going after... Judy Blume. I've got nothing. https://t.co/FMHRZAXPTe\n\nLast year, Freeman profiled The Handmaid\u2019s Tale author Margaret Atwood for the Guardian. In one tense exchange, Freeman repeatedly pressed Atwood to clarify her views on trans people.\n\n\u201cEverything in nature is on a bell curve. We have this two-box thinking [about gender] because it\u2019s biblical, so wool over here, linen over there,\u201d Atwood said.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re making too much of this!\u201d Atwood eventually told Freeman.\n\nAtwood\u2019s handling of Freeman\u2019s questions received praise in the LGBTQ media.\u00a0\n\nFollowing the Blume controversy, many criticized Freeman for what they said was her obsession with the trans community.\n\nDoes Hadley Freeman have a list of her favourite authors to interview solely to ask if they\u2019re rabid terfs like her? Can one of her friends sit her down and ask if she\u2019s okay? https://t.co/MXzie3odmN\n\nImagine interviewing Judy Blume \u2014 a dream \u2014 and misrepresenting her so throughly on your hobby horse topic that she has to issue a statement calling what you did \u201cbullshit\u201d. That would be a VERY bad day at the office in my book.\n\nThis headline, in addition to being manipulated and misleading, is also just insulting: you\u2019re interviewing Judy Blume about her career, and you lead with this?\n\nHadley Freeman\u2019s dedication to interviewing legendary authors like Judy Blume and Margaret Atwood to minimize their literary achievements and twist their words into support of her own anti-trans rhetoric is as well-documented as it is pathological and inane. https://t.co/akHhcwk6be\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, Freeman defended her story and denied taking Blume\u2019s comments out of context or misquoting her.\n\n\u201cI did not ask Blume about the criticisms against JK Rowling - she brought them up herself,\u201d Freeman said.\n\n\u201cThere is much to be said about how gross it is today that Blume - of all wonderful people - is publicly dragged for showing friendship to another female author,\u201d Freeman added. \u201cBut I\u2019ll just say, all the men on here who get off on screaming at women supporting women? Seek help.\u201d\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Harvey Weinstein Is Getting 16 More Years In Prison After A Los Angeles Jury Found Him Guilty Of Multiple Sex Crimes\n\nThe former media mogul is already serving a 23-year sentence after being found guilty of rape and sexual assault in New York in 2020.\n\nHarvey Weinstein appears in court in Los Angeles on Oct. 4, 2022.\n\nFormer movie producer Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to an additional 16 years in prison on Thursday for his rape and sexual assault conviction in Los Angeles.\n\nIn December, a jury found Weinstein guilty of one count of forcible oral copulation, one count of sexual penetration by a foreign object, and one count of forcible rape, all involving Jane Doe 1. He was acquitted of one count of sexual battery by restraint related to another Jane Doe, while a mistrial was declared on charges involving two other women, including Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the filmmaker and wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe former movie mogul is already serving a 23-year sentence after being found guilty of rape and sexual assault in New York in 2020. For his Los Angeles conviction, Weinstein was facing up to 18 years in prison on top of that time.\n\nBefore Weinstein learned his fate, Jane Doe 1, the former model and actor who testified that the former producer raped her in February 2013, told the court that the effects of the sexual assault are still \"raw and difficult to discuss\" 10 years after it occurred.\n\n\"I have been carrying this weight, this trauma. This irrational belief that it was my fault,\" Jane Doe 1 told the court on Thursday. \"His selfish, disgusting actions have greatly impacted my life.\u00a0Before that night, I was a very happy and confident woman. I valued myself and the relationship I had with God. I was excited about my future. Everything changed after the defendant brutally assaulted me.\"\n\n\"I thought I did something wrong because he chose me that night. I thought I did something wrong for him to do that to me,\" she continued. \"I soon became invisible to myself and to the world. I lost my identity. I was heartbroken, empty, and alone.\"\n\n\"There is no prison sentence long enough to erase the damage. I'm still learning every day how to live with this,\" she said.\n\n\"By coming forward, I raised my voice,\" Jane Doe 1 added. \"I\u2019m no longer invisible.\"\n\nIn his own statement to the court on Thursday, Weinstein maintained his innocence and accused Jane Doe 1 of lying, calling her account a \"made up story.\" He said, \"I maintain that I\u2019m innocent. I never raped or sexually assaulted Jane Doe 1. I never knew this woman, and the fact is she doesn\u2019t know me. This is about money.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles verdict came five years after the New York Times and the New Yorker first reported on the accusations that Weinstein had a history of sexually assaulting, sexually harassing, and raping women in the industry. Those stories prompted a reckoning within Hollywood and contributed to the explosion of the #MeToo movement.\n\nSince then, more than 90 women have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct.\n\n\"Today, justice has been served,\" Elizabeth Fegan, the attorney who represented Jennifer Siebel Newsom and Ashley Matthau in the Los Angeles trial, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News after Weinstein's sentence was announced on Thursday. \"In delivering a 16-year sentence, Judge Lisa Lench has ensured that Harvey Weinstein will spend the rest of his life behind bars.\n\n\"The verdict and the sentence were possible because eight very courageous women stepped forward to confront this serial rapist,\" Fegan added.\n\nIn a statement to BuzzFeed News, Weinstein's spokesperson, Juda Engelmayer, called the sentence \"cruel\" due to his age and health and said that Jane Doe 1 lied about her accusation.\n\n\"It\u2019s not justice, but a pile on for a man many people just decided should be cast off and discarded regardless of facts. It will be appealed,\" Engelmayer said.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lisa B. Lench denied Weinstein's motion for a new trial. In the motion, his attorneys said they wanted to set right \"prejudicial errors\" and alleged that they had evidence that would impact the credibility of Jane Doe 1's testimony.\n\nProsecutors refuted his attorneys\u2019 claims and argued that a new trial would not result in a different verdict.\u00a0\n\nDuring the monthslong trial in Los Angeles, the jury, made up of eight men and four women, heard from more than 50 witnesses, including the four alleged victims. Siebel Newsom, who first shared her experience with Weinstein in an op-ed published by HuffPost in 2017, testified that he had raped her in a hotel room during what she thought would be a business meeting in 2005 when she was a young actor in the industry.\n\n\"Harvey Weinstein will never be able to rape another woman,\" Siebel Newsom said in a statement after the verdict was announced. \"He will spend the rest of his life behind bars where he belongs.\"\n\nThroughout both criminal cases in New York and Los Angeles, Weinstein, 70, maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty. After the Los Angeles verdict was announced, his representative told BuzzFeed News that Weinstein was \"determined to continue his legal challenges in ultimately proving his innocence.\"\n\nWeinstein is currently appealing his New York conviction. His lawyers are arguing that the women\u2019s testimony led the New York jury to focus on the history and pattern of allegations rather than on specific charges relevant to the case, among other issues.\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\nStephanie Baer is a reporter with BuzzFeed News and is based in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nContact Stephanie K.

        "article": "# \u201cSuccession\u201d Takes A Big Storytelling Risk And Pulls It Off\n\n(Warning: major spoilers.) The series has been heading toward this moment.\n\n\u201cConnor\u2019s Wedding\u201d starts like any other episode of Succession. Media titan Logan Roy (Brian Cox) is preparing yet another blockbuster series of business moves. He\u2019s trying to drive a wedge right into the middle of a fragile alliance between his children. He\u2019s skipping his eldest son\u2019s wedding in favor of traveling to Sweden to finish selling off the bulk of Waystar-Royco, the company he founded, to digital entertainment company Gojo. The stakes of the HBO show\u2019s final season seem clear: Logan longs to secure his legacy, and his kids get in the way at every turn.\u00a0\n\nAnd then Logan dies. Unexpectedly. On the plane to Sweden. Arguably the main character of Succession, the guy around whom the entire show revolves, dies three episodes into the final season, leaving a massive mess behind.\u00a0\n\nYet isn\u2019t that how death often enters our lives \u2014 unexpectedly, on a day that seems like any other day until it very abruptly, wrenchingly doesn\u2019t?\n\nWhile it is not unprecedented for a drama series to kill a character as major as Logan at this point in its run \u2014 most notably, Six Feet Under killed Nate Fisher (Peter Krause) halfway through its final season \u2014 it\u2019s certainly rare. And even in the very small number of shows that have made a similar storytelling choice, Succession stands alone for capturing as well as any episode of television I\u2019ve ever seen the messy, grimy reality of the immediate minutes and hours after someone\u2019s death, particularly when it\u2019s someone you had very complicated feelings about.\u00a0\n\nSuccession has always taken death seriously. The show debuted in 2018, at the tail end of an era when many TV shows, chasing the high ratings of The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones, luxuriated in cheap death, running up the body count to provide ever greater shocks and buzz. Succession is not above treating death as something farcical, as in a Season 2 episode where the funeral of a sex pest/Waystar board member is mainly an opportunity for the characters to insist they had no connection to the man, highlighting their complicity in any number of crimes in comedic fashion.\u00a0\n\nMost of the time, though, the show treats death with the appropriate gravity. No matter how much money and power Logan Roy accumulates, he won\u2019t be able to take it with him. The series opens with scenes highlighting how frail Logan\u2019s aging body and mind have become, and in the first few episodes, he experiences a serious health crisis that leaves his kids reeling as to what will happen after his death. (Hence the show\u2019s title.) His flagging health continues to be a major theme throughout the show\u2019s run. In the final season premiere, no less, Logan has a conversation with his bodyguard \u2014 one of the few people still talking to him at that juncture \u2014 about whether there\u2019s anything after this life. Logan doesn\u2019t think there is, and that seems to motivate him to accumulate as much as he can while he\u2019s still alive. His last line of dialogue on the show has him calling for his underlings to be \u201ca bit more fucking aggressive!\u201d in making business moves. Right up until his death, he\u2019s trying to gobble up even more.\n\nThis treatment of death as a constant shadow on the characters\u2019 lives extends beyond Logan. His depressive son, Kendall (Jeremy Strong), has seemed on the brink of dying by suicide multiple times throughout the show\u2019s run, and the series always underscores the bleakness of those moments. Most memorably, in an episode late in Season 3, Kendall sticks his face into a swimming pool, as though he is on the brink of attempting to drown himself. In the next episode, it\u2019s implied that he came very close to succeeding before being rescued. Though Kendall can be a ridiculous character, whose awful venality is subject to the same \u201cthese are not good people\u201d treatment as all of the other Roys, the show is careful to take his moments of suicidal ideation seriously. Even when you\u2019re as rich as a Roy, death is something that can\u2019t be taken back.\n\nAll of this consideration of death lays the groundwork for \u201cConnor\u2019s Wedding.\u201d The episode feints as a typical Succession installment for its first 15 minutes. Logan skips Connor\u2019s (Alan Ruck) wedding, and asks youngest son Roman (Kieran Culkin) to let Waystar\u2019s CEO know she\u2019s about to be fired right as the festivities are getting underway. It\u2019s easy to imagine a version of the episode that turns into a dark farce, with corporate skullduggery taking place under the surface of what\u2019s outwardly a lovely party. That episode would surely be incredibly funny, with an added kernel of tragedy at the way the Roys\u2019 abusive family dynamics, modeled on Logan\u2019s behavior, don\u2019t allow them to connect with each other, even at a big celebration. Indeed, both the Season 1 and Season 3 finales, which are set at family weddings, more or less fit that description.\n\nOnce Logan\u2019s collapse is revealed, however, the episode takes on an entirely different tone, not just from its first 15 minutes but from the show as a whole. The show\u2019s typical \u201cnature documentary about the ultrarich\u201d style eases back into something looser and more flowing. There are long shots that follow a single character, trapped in their grief, as they go to find some other person to bring the bad news, and their reactions show how profoundly they are affected. Where, for instance, Culkin usually brings an air of sarcastic insouciance to Roman, in this episode, Roman is reduced to a scared little boy, insisting that his dad can\u2019t be dead until a doctor says so as he sits with his legs folded up underneath himself.\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s clear throughout the episode, however, is that no matter how much money the Roys have, there is nothing they can do. They can call every doctor in the world and throw as much money as they have at them. They can demand their father\u2019s plane turn back around for New York. They can insist that their dad isn\u2019t dead until they say he is, and they can delay news of his death getting out as long as possible to try to preserve the company\u2019s market share, and they can write the perfect statement to deliver to the press. But they can\u2019t stop death. It\u2019s been haunting the series all along, and even if Logan bought himself a few more years after the scare in the series premiere, it still caught up to him. There\u2019s nothing they can do. There\u2019s nothing any of us can do.\n\nWhat Succession also understands about death is how it engraves who we were in stone. Up until you die, there is still a chance you might change your ways, repent for your worst deeds, find a way to make it up to those you\u2019ve hurt. As the novelist Per Petterson wrote in his book I Curse the River of Time, at the moment of your death, \u201cyou suddenly realize that every chance of being the person you really wanted to be, is gone forever, and the one you were, is the one those around you will remember.\u201d\u00a0\n\nConsider that idea in light of a tyrant like Logan, who terrorized his children long before the series began and hurled abusive invective at them throughout its run. The longest single scene in the episode involves Kendall, Roman, and their sister Shiv (Sarah Snook) speaking over the phone into their father\u2019s ear. They do not know if he can hear them. He might already be dead. But the airplane\u2019s attendants are continuing chest compressions, so there\u2019s always a chance their words will leak through to what remains of his consciousness.\n\nThroughout this scene, it\u2019s as though we watch Kendall, Roman, and Shiv\u2019s memories of their father start to calcify. Now that there\u2019s no chance for him to redeem himself in their eyes, they can feel the gap between the father they might have wanted and the one they actually got.\u00a0\n\nRoman tearfully insists, \u201cYou\u2019re a good dad,\u201d and later freaks out that he might not have told Logan he loved him. Yet the very first thing he says to Logan is, \u201cYou\u2019re a monster.\u201d He means it as a compliment, but it\u2019s not hard to hear the darker side to that statement. Kendall hems and haws and offers a very unconvincing \u201cI love you.\u201d But he finally says, bluntly, \u201cI can\u2019t forgive you.\u201d Shiv, when she hears the news, says, \u201cI can\u2019t have that,\u201d like she\u2019s trying to send back an order at a restaurant. She, too, tries to tell her father she loves him, then immediately pivots to how \u201cthere\u2019s no excuse for\u2026\u201d She trails off. There\u2019s no excuse for so much of what Logan did.\u00a0\n\nSeveral scenes later, Connor finds out, his siblings having finally told him after they\u2019ve known for a while. He says his dad never liked him. He quickly reverses that, but his first impulse is to underline all of the ways Logan tossed his eldest son aside, to the degree that he wasn\u2019t even going to attend Connor\u2019s wedding.\u00a0\n\nThe ways in which the Roy children think about their dad will surely shift as they process his death, but, crucially, Logan no longer controls his narrative. When considering memorial options, Kendall suggests repurposing the funeral of Ronald Reagan \u201cwith tweaks,\u201d instead of planning something more intimately tied to who Logan was. When Shiv reads a rudimentary obituary for the press, flanked by Roman and Kendall, the kids are taking over Logan\u2019s life story for him. When they\u2019re done, all the reporters care about is who will take over the company. Logan is gone. He\u2019s already being turned into a figurehead. There\u2019s no more room for him in the story.\u00a0\n\nKilling off Logan with seven episodes to go in the series underlines that Succession treats death with a gravity too few TV shows do. Logan literally built an empire. He was an abusive father. He sometimes seemed to love his kids deeply. He was a media mogul with a golden gut that had gotten less solid as he aged. He had a body that was failing him. His preference for a bloodthirsty presentation of the news cheapened global politics. He was a complicated man. But that\u2019s the point: He was. Now, all he is is dead, and others will write about him in their memoirs. He\u2019ll have no say in the matter.\n\nAs the episode ends, life goes on without him, as it must. The kids give their statement, and Shiv reconnects, for just a moment, with her estranged husband. Roman goes up into the plane to see the body. Connor goes through with the wedding. Kendall waits outside, processing enormous emotions he might never figure out. The camera keeps its distance from him, then zooms in suddenly, forcing us into his thoughts, as if he\u2019s finally understanding what\u2019s happened and how present death has always been in his life. All of the Roys will die someday, too, their stories written by others just as surely as they\u2019ll write Logan\u2019s.\u00a0\n\nSuccession\u2019s ostensible plot has always been about which of the Roy children will take over for their father as the head of Waystar. Now, that question is more urgent than ever, but the show has already answered it in a way other than fans might have expected: It doesn\u2019t matter. No matter how vast the empire you build, you will die, and the person you were will be defined by others. So what good is spreading anger, abuse, and cruelty with the one life you get?\u00a0\n\nLogan doesn\u2019t get another chance to answer that question. His children might. Yet if you\u2019ve seen this show at all, you already know the answer. They won\u2019t reconsider anything because of this. They\u2019ll double down. They\u2019ll keep chasing the throne right off the cliff.\u00a0\u25cf\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

She wasn\u2019t as naturally warm.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAs Andy expressed his shock, the star added: \u201cBut maybe, I don\u2019t know, my mom being Australian just asked her all these slightly rude questions.\u201d\n\n\n## \nWhen quizzed on what exactly her mom was asking, Rebel went on: \u201c\u2018Where are your kids\u2019 and things like that. And I\u2019m like: \u2018Ma, don\u2019t ask her that!\u2019\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s why she was a little standoffish!\u201d Andy then argued.\n\n\nRebel Wilson Calles Out Meghan Markle For Not Being \"Friendly\"! #meghanmarkleandprinceharry #meghanmarkleconfessions #theharkles #princeharrry #royalnewscircle #royalgossip #fyproyals #ukroyals\ud83d\udc51 #royaltiktok\n\n## \nAnd many people are inclined to agree, with Rebel receiving backlash on social media for expecting Meghan to be welcoming despite the self-confessed rudeness from her mom.\n\n\n## \nDiscussing the anecdote on a Reddit forum, one person wrote: \u201cGee, I can\u2019t imagine why Meghan wouldn\u2019t respond with warmth and charm after being asked rude questions! A real mystery there!\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cHold on. Rebel Wilson's mum asks Meghan Markle rude questions and now Rebel is prattling on about how Meghan wasn't 'naturally warm' to them,\u201d another tweeted. \u201cThere's a lot to unpick here but let's start off with the fact that you can't expect someone to be welcoming when you are rude to them.\u201d\n\n\nHold on.\nRebel Wilson's mum asks Meghan Markle rude questions and now Rebel is prattling on about how Meghan wasn't 'naturally warm' to them. \nThere's a lot to unpick here but let's start off with the fact that you can't expect someone to be welcoming when you are rude to them.\n\n## \n\u201cSo Rebel and her mum were rude to Meghan and they are surprised Meghan wasn\u2019t warm back? Can\u2019t expect someone to be welcoming when you are rude to them,\u201d one more commented.\n\n\n## \n\u201cI bet that\u2019s not the only \u2018slightly rude\u2019 question her mom asked. These people are all so entitled,\u201d another claimed.\n\n\n## \n\u201cIt reveals so much about RW that she didn't spin this anecdote into 'I can't take my mom anywhere, you wouldn't believe how she was with Meghan,'\u201d someone else wrote. \u201cAlso this is a great example of how Black women are perceived as \u2018angry\u2019 or \u2018unfriendly\u2019\u2014Black women in particular are expected to always be friendly and like, laugh along with everyone's tired racist jokes?? And if not, the racists feel personally wounded to realize not everyone is going along with their BS.\u201d\n\n\n## \nRebel was also accused of hypocrisy as people pointed out that she expressed her exasperation when she was forced to defend going out partying in the weeks after her baby\u2019s birth.\n\n\n## \nRebel welcomed a daughter via surrogate in November, and just last month she said on the Life Uncut podcast: \u201cIt was only a week until I got mom-shamed. I was shocked at the criticism because Chris Hemsworth goes to the gym, and people aren't yelling, 'Where's your kids?' But why do they do it to every woman?\u201d\n\n\n## \nTweeting screenshots of Rebel\u2019s quotes, a critic wrote: \u201cYet this is her complaining at being harassed for the exact same shit! @RebelWilson is a disgusting hypocrite and fake as hell.\u201d\n\n\n## \nSomeone else agreed: \u201cShe literally complained to the press when the same thing happened to her. She found it rude.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnd others highlighted the fact that Rebel took a very public swipe at Harry and Meghan prior to meeting them, which may have also been a factor in Meghan\u2019s lack of warmth.\n\n\n## \nWhen Rebel hosted the 2022 BAFTAs, she said of the couple: \"From drama, to horror, to fantasy... Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah had it all!\"\n\n\n## \n\u201cRebel Wilson is rude and classless. She mocked Harry and Meghan at the BAFTAs. Then her mom asks a rude question to Meghan\u2019s face and she wonders why Meghan is not warm towards her?\u201d one person tweeted. \u201cGirl, bye. Meghan\u2019s kids are none of your business!\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnother posted the BAFTAs clip and wrote: \u201cMeghan Markle wasn\u2019t \u2018naturally warm\u2019 to you because you said this about her roughly 2 months prior. #DontBeDaft\u201d\n\n\nBAFTA 2022 Film Awards: Host Rebel Wilson mocks #UARushChallenge #baftaawards #bafta #bafta2022 #bafta2022filmawards #rebelwilson #princeharry #meghanmarkle #oprahwinfry #oprah #interview #fyp#meghan #rebel #harry#meghan #viral#awards2022\n\n## \n\u201cIf I recall correctly Rebel Wilson spoke ill of Meghan at the BAFTA - then expected her to be warm & friendly? & then you or your mother ask a bunch of rude questions??? Is this lady nuts. The audacity of woman,\u201d someone else added.\n\n\n## \nRebel has not publicly acknowledged the backlash, and BuzzFeed News has contacted her rep for comment.\n\n\n## \nMeanwhile, this is far from the first time that the actor has courted controversy in recent months. The star \u2014 who came out as gay in June \u2013 was heavily criticized in January when she promoted a Dubai hotel on her Instagram page after she and her now-fianc\u00e9 were among the celebrity guests at its lavish launch.\n\n\n## \nRebel was accused of not acknowledging her privilege as followers quickly pointed out that many members of her own community would be at risk if they traveled to the UAE city, where same-sex sexual activity is punishable by the death penalty in compliance with Sharia law.\n\n\n## \n\u201cGee Rebel. You do know that it\u2019s the death penalty in Dubai for homosexuality?? Supporting such a country is really really poor form, especially as a member of that community \ud83e\udd2f\u201d one of her followers commented at the time.\n\n\n## \nAnd in 2018, Rebel was accused of blocking women of color who attempted to correct her after she claimed to be the first plus-size woman lead a rom-com.\n\n\n## \nIt was quickly pointed out that this isn\u2019t true, and Rebel was accused of erasing the work of Black actors, such as Mo'Nique and Queen Latifah.\n\n\n## \nRebel later apologized for her comment and her actions, saying: \u201cI blocked people on Twitter because I was hurting from the criticism, but those are the people I actually need to hear from more, not less.\u201d\n\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# A Group Of Florida LGBTQ Kids Are Learning How To Fight Back\n\n\u201cJust literally for one day you can be completely unabashedly yourself and be that queer teen that Florida seems to be afraid of.\u201d\n\nReporting From\n\nOllie, at the 2023 Youth Pride Conference sponsored by GLSEN Collier County on March 25, 2023, in Naples, Florida\n\nNAPLES, Florida \u2014 \u201cI love Florida, but Florida doesn\u2019t love me back.\u201d\n\nThose were the words of Ollie, a nonbinary high school senior in Collier County who has lived in Florida all their life, but who is now plotting their escape. Last year, extreme bullying at school forced Ollie to switch to a dual enrollment program at a local college. They can\u2019t help feeling they were driven away because of their identity, cheated out of a more tolerant environment or safe space by much more powerful figures.\n\n\u201cI just felt completely dehumanized. I felt like a piece of meat. I felt like there was a perpetual target on my back,\u201d Ollie told BuzzFeed News of the bullying they endured. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I was safe. And if you don\u2019t even feel safe in a place of learning, how could you ever expect to actually prosper?\u201d\u00a0\n\nOllie still feels their adrenaline spike in terror when large groups of people approach them, but there is at least one place where they have felt it\u2019s safe to exhale.\n\nOn Saturday in Naples, a longtime mecca for wealthy retirees where white Gulf Coast beaches meet webs of mangrove forests, Ollie and more than two dozen teens gathered in the annex buildings of a white-steepled Protestant church ringed by palm trees. They were all here at the Youth Pride Conference to discuss what it\u2019s like to be a young queer person in Florida today.\u00a0\n\nThe conference, open to kids in grades 6 to 12, was the work of GLSEN Collier County, one of 43 chapters of a national nonprofit founded by teachers in 1990 with the aim of helping LGBTQ youth. Now in its second year, the conference had two primary goals: to give queer kids tools to survive and to teach them how to thrive.\u00a0\n\nDaniel Shaw speaks at the 2023 Youth Pride Conference on March 25, 2023, in Naples, Florida.\n\n\u201cI know after watching the kids last year and seeing the way they were liberated in a way I\u2019ve never seen them, that it didn\u2019t matter how many kids came,\u201d said Daniel Shaw, a 40-year-old math teacher in Collier County and the GLSEN chapter director. \u201cFor every single one there, it had the power to change their lives and the trajectory of their lives in a significant capacity.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s event included a drag performance that generated angry, sensationalist headlines in the Daily Mail and Fox News. The ensuing controversy triggered a protest of the conference by about 35 people, including members of the far-right Proud Boys, who held signs with the word \u201cgroomer\u201d on them and called on children to repent.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey were wearing masks. They were holding signs. It seemed like there were going to be threats of violence. It was much, much scarier,\u201d said Via, a high school senior and lesbian who served as cochair of this year\u2019s conference with Ollie.\u00a0\n\nWhile Saturday\u2019s event was protest-free, a marked police car could still be seen in the parking lot as guests exited.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInside, sitting at tables decorated with rainbows and practically every variation of the Pride flag, kids heard speeches from activists and organizers. They took notes and listened intently during breakout sessions on the legal landscape in Florida and how to be an activist. They talked about the history of book bans and what constitutes a healthy romantic relationship with a partner. And they wore shirts emblazoned with the words, \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u2026.SHOUT IT.\u201d\n\nIn a state that has helped lead a national crackdown on the rights of LGBTQ people, this gathering \u2014 small as it was \u2014 felt almost radical. Here, at this meeting of the resistance, which BuzzFeed News was the sole media outlet invited to attend, the teens could get information they\u2019ve been blocked from receiving in schools and swap stories of shared experiences. Even simply talking with adults and other kids about what it feels like to be queer was itself practically an act of defiance.\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust literally for one day you can be completely unabashedly yourself and be that queer teen that Florida seems to be afraid of,\u201d Ollie said. (BuzzFeed News is withholding the last names of minors interviewed for this story to protect their identities. All were interviewed with the written consent of their parents.)\u00a0\n\nFeeling free to be yourself was a common refrain among those who attended. Kids introduced themselves with their pronouns and wore what clothing they wanted. One student, Aurora, arrived draped in the pansexual flag as if it were a superhero cape, while another senior named William changed into a skirt upon arriving.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t dress the way I\u2019m dressing now in school. This is my alter ego,\u201d William said. \u201cBut I feel like I could just walk around here \u2014 like I could run.\u201d\n\nTo be a queer child in Florida today is to have a target placed on your back, not just by the bullies in school hallways who might bark at you as you pass, but by your own government. Under the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Sunshine state has been at the forefront of a dark national cloud curtailing the rights of LGBTQ people.\u00a0\n\nThis effort has been two-pronged: a legal bombardment of bills framed around protecting parents\u2019 rights and a cultural or media strategy that pushes an unfounded moral panic in order to justify the crackdown. (It was DeSantis\u2019s own firebrand press secretary who helped spur the return of the hateful trope of \u201cgrooming\u201d to national prominence last year.)\n\n\u201cThe same generation that never wanted to see queer people be married are now seeing queer people come out in middle school like they\u2019Zander Moriczve never done before. So there's anger and hurt there that can be activated,\u201d said Zander Moricz, a Florida high school graduate who addressed the Naples conference on Saturday after going viral last year for his commencement speech in which he skirted a ban on using the word \u201cgay\u201d by replacing it with references to his curly hair.\n\nZander Moricz\u00a0speaks at the 2023 Youth Pride Conference on March 25, 2023, in Naples, Florida.\n\nMost prominently, there was the passage in March last year of the Parental Rights in Education Act, known widely to critics as the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law, which restricted \u201cclassroom instruction \u2026 on sexual orientation or gender identity\u201d for children up to the third grade and discussions of those subjects \u201cin a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBut the new law isn\u2019t just affecting young children. It has chilled speech in classrooms across Florida, with school officials fearful of lawsuits taking down rainbow decorations or avoiding certain topics. Some have felt afraid to mention their own same-gender spouses. Just last week, days before the kids gathered in Naples, DeSantis signaled his intention to expand \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d from its current form to officially cover students from grades 4 to 12.\n\nAnother law has empowered any resident of Florida to lodge objections to material in classrooms or school libraries, which conservative groups have seized on to lobby for scores of books that discuss LGBTQ or race issues to be banned. Bookshelves have been covered to shield them from view as their contents await screening and approval by certified officials.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe most victimized students in Florida, though, have been transgender or nonbinary children. In addition to a 2021 law banning transgender girls from playing in sports teams for student-athletes who were assigned female at birth, a ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors took effect this month.\u00a0\n\nThis law prompted Kayak, a 17-year-old junior who identifies as transmasc nonbinary, to race to begin hormone replacement therapy in December so they\u2019d be covered by an exception that protects minors who have already started their treatments\u00a0\n\nThe combined effect of these attacks has left LGBTQ students like Kayak feeling dismayed or worse. According to a 2022 survey from the Trevor Project, a suicide prevention nonprofit, 45% of Florida LGBTQ youth seriously considered suicide in the past year and 16% attempted it. These rates are higher for transgender or nonbinary youth at 54% and 20%, respectively.\u00a0\n\nThe Trevor Project notes that LGBTQ young people are not inherently prone to being at a higher risk for suicide, but rather find themselves at increased risk due to social stigma or mistreatment. Their report found that 74% of respondents had experienced discrimination in the last year, while 86% felt recent politics had negatively affected their well-being sometimes or a lot. Laws framed as protecting children are actively harming them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just scary to exist here because I\u2019m becoming a queer adult. And when you transition from a queer child to a queer adult, you go from a victim to a \u2018groomer,\u2019 to a pedophile,\u201d Kayak said. \u201cAs a trans guy, I\u2019m terrified of being a trans adult because then I\u2019m a \u2018bad person.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the political onslaught isn\u2019t over. There are 10 more bills still pending in the state legislature that the ACLU has identified as harmful to LGBTQ people, including a bill restricting bathroom use for transgender people and a broadly worded bill that would, among other things, require all transgender youth to detransition. If it\u2019s passed, parents who try to seek gender-affirming care for their children in another state could have their kids removed from their custody.\u00a0\n\nIt was for these reasons that Shaw, the GLSEN chapter director, said the conference discussion on gender-affirming care was critically important because it would share information that some kids might be desperately trying to look for online. Instead, nurse Mishya Nishioka, the director of gender-affirming hormone therapy services for Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida, talked with interested attendees about hormone options, fertility preservation, and updating gender identity on legal documents.\n\n\u201cThe presentation for some of those kids is going to be lifesaving,\u201d Shaw said.\u00a0\n\nLeft: Kayak; right: Via\n\nShaw estimated that he\u2019s been putting in 20 to 30 hours of extra work per week to plan for the conference with his so-called Shine team of student organizers that included Ollie, Via, and Kayak, among others. It\u2019s a lot for a full-time public school teacher who has a husband and two young boys at home, but Shaw views it as a higher calling.\u00a0\n\nRaised in a conservative Baptist family in Indiana to whom he did not come out as gay until he was 28, Shaw said he had been transformed by hearing the struggles of his transgender and nonbinary students. \u201cNobody can listen to their stories and not have it be personal. It\u2019s not possible. Not if you\u2019re human,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nAsh\n\nThe respect \u2014 and gratitude \u2014 is mutual. \u201cHe\u2019s a pretty passionate person. He likes to do what he likes to do. He likes to say what he believes in. He doesn\u2019t like to step down,\u201d said Ash, a nonbinary senior at Shaw\u2019s school and another Shine organizer. \u201cEven though he might have the risk of getting fired because of him standing up for GSA,\u201d the school\u2019s Genders and Sexualities Alliance, \u201che\u2019d rather have his students be safe rather than anything else.\u201d\n\nShaw doesn\u2019t tell the kids that he thinks the fight they\u2019re in now will be a long one. It\u2019ll take a decade or two to unwind the legislative damage that\u2019s been done to the queer community in Florida, he believes. But right now his students are mostly in a fight for survival and Shaw thinks he can help them by staying true to who he is, even in his own classroom.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to not talk about my life,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cI refuse to go back into the closet because you want to make me controversial.\u201d\n\nMoricz, the viral high school graduate invited to address the conference guests, delivered a similar message in his keynote address. Moricz has put his studies at Harvard University on hold for a year to devote himself to activism, describing this current moment as an emergency. \u201cWe cannot change laws today. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t change laws tomorrow if we start today,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\nFunding has already been secured for next year\u2019s conference thanks to a large donation from the Dyson Foundation and its trustee and director Tim Massie, who has been splitting his time between New York\u2019s Hudson Valley and the Naples area for nine years.\n\nMassie attended Saturday\u2019s conference with Pete Clark, his husband and partner of more than four decades. Together, the pair marveled at the courage of Florida\u2019s queer kids \u2014 at how much has changed since they were their age and how much progress has been lost.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to despair because there are groups out there, like GLSEN, to let you know you are supported, you are loved,\u201d Massie told the crowd. \u201cYou are \u2014 right now \u2014 who you were meant to be.\u201d\n\nAs the conference ended, local queer musician Sheena Brook took the stage a final time, strumming her guitar to a mashup of Sara Bareilles\u2019s \u201cBrave\u201d and Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cRoar.\u201d\n\nAsh (center) dances with Ollie and other attendees of the\u00a02023 Youth Pride Conference on March 25, 2023, in Naples, Florida.\n\nOne by one, the kids stood up from the tables and started dancing \u2014 awkwardly at first, but then giggling at how awkward it was, which made it sort of fun. Soon, they were all on their feet, dancing and laughing. Kayak even went over to a shy teen who\u2019d been sitting alone in the corner and dragged them onto the makeshift dance floor. They too were now smiling.\u00a0\n\nIt was an unscripted scene of pure, goofy happiness, and for a brief moment they weren\u2019t political targets or media subjects or problems to be fixed; they were just kids being kids.\u00a0\n\nShaw leaned in, his eyes welling with tears, and whispered, \u201cThis is why we do it.\u201d \u25cf\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

Alex had been stealing millions of dollars from his law firm, multiple witnesses said, and may have feared his alleged financial crimes were about to be revealed. His \u201cego couldn\u2019t stand that,\u201d so he murdered his family in a desperate attempt to garner sympathy and protect his good name, prosecutors alleged.\n\n\u201cThe entire illusion of his life was about to be altered \u2014 he couldn't live with that,\u201d lead prosecutor Creighton Waters said. \u201cHe's the kind of person for which shame is an extraordinary provocation.\u201d\n\nThe defense pushed back at this claim on Thursday, saying Alex \u201cadored and loved\u201d his family and would never have harmed them.\n\n\u201cEven if the financial day of reckoning was impending, if it was right there, Alex would not have killed the people he loved the most in the world,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThere's no evidence that he would do that.\u201d\n\nBut in their rebuttal, prosecutors reaffirmed their stance that Alex was being driven by his ego more than anything else.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think he loved Maggie. I think he loved Paul,\u201d prosecutor John Meadors said. \u201cBut you know who he loved more than that? \u2026 He loved Alex.\u201d\n\nHe also reminded the jury of Alex\u2019s tendency to lie. \u201cWhat he did when he took the stand was corroborate that he's a liar and corroborate the fact that he doesn't tell the truth,\u201d Meadors said.\n\nJury deliberations are now underway. In order to convict Alex of murder, all 12 jurors will have to be unanimous in their decision.\u00a0\n\nGriffin appealed to the jury, saying that if any of them have even a shred of doubt that Alex is guilty, they should not convict him.\n\n\u201cWith your words, you can let everyone know that in a court of law, only evidence and the burden of proof matters, not gossip, innuendo, opinions, and most of all, not theories layered on top of speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are two words that justice demands in this case, and those two words are not guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn behalf of Alex, on behalf of Buster, on behalf of Maggie, and on behalf of my friend Paul,\u201d Griffin said, sounding choked up, \u201cI respectfully request that you do not compound a family tragedy with another.\u201d\n\nThe prosecution hit back against the defense\u2019s closing argument, saying they don\u2019t need to answer every single question to prove the case. If the jury is sufficiently convinced of Alex\u2019s guilt, they should convict, Meadors said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere's not a book on how to be a juror, but you have been preparing for this moment in this courtroom to decide this case for your entire life \u2014 and it's called life,\u201d Meadors said. \u201cIt's called living. It's called experiences. It's called interacting with your spouse, your children, your neighbors, your coworkers, your good experiences, your bad experiences, evaluating people and deciding what's credible.\n\n\u201cThis is a common-sense case,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd you didn't leave that common sense with you when you came here six weeks ago. It's with you now, it's been with you during the six weeks here, and you're going to take it back into the jury room.\u201d\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# The Latest Selena Gomez And Hailey Bieber Drama Has Reminded People That Hailey Was Once A Hardcore Justin Bieber Stan Who Was Obsessed With His And Selena\u2019s Relationship\n\nOne of Hailey\u2019s 2011 tweets reads: \u201cI don't care what anyone says but Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez together is the definition of a teenage dream!\u201d\n\n## \nLast week, Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber\u2019s rumored feud came back with a vengeance thanks to a whole heap of shady social media activity from both parties.\n\n\n## \nThe two have been at the center of rivalry speculation since 2018, when Selena\u2019s ex Justin Bieber married Hailey just six months after he\u2019d split from the singer.\n\n\n## \nIn October, Hailey and Selena attempted to quash the rumors when they were photographed together at the Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles, but it has all kicked off once again.\n\n\n## \nThe latest drama started on Tuesday when Selena posted about \u201caccidentally\u201d laminating her eyebrows too much in a TikTok post.\n\n\n## \nJust three hours later, Hailey\u2019s friend Kylie Jenner uploaded a selfie to her Instagram story with the text \u201cthis was an accident???\u201d suspiciously placed by her eyebrows.\n\n\n## \nNot long after that, Kylie posted a screenshot from a FaceTime call with Hailey, where they had both zoomed in on their eyebrows.\n\n\n## \nPeople began to call Kylie and Hailey out for their \u201cmean girl\u201d behavior on social media, and Kylie quickly backtracked. Commenting on a TikTok that accused her and Hailey of being \u201cchildish,\u201d Kylie wrote: \u201cno shade towards selena ever and i didn\u2019t see her eyebrow posts! u guys are making something out of nothing. this is silly.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnd Selena backed Kylie up, replying to the comment: \u201cAgreed @kyliejenner. It\u2019s all unnecessary. I\u2019m a fan of Kylie!\u201d\n\n\n## \nBut on Thursday Selena appeared to reignite the drama when she left a shady comment on a resurfaced clip of Hailey from 2017.\n\n\n## \nIn the video, which was posted to TikTok, Hailey can be seen pretending to gag when Selena\u2019s best friend Taylor Swift is mentioned. Even though the video is almost six years old, Selena decided to leap to her bestie\u2019s defense.\n\n\n## \n\u201cSo sorry, my best friend is and continues to be one of the best in the game,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\n## \nThis decision divided people, with some accusing Selena of needlessly fueling the rivalry with the comment. But Selena continued to fan the flames, and she was seen commenting \u201cI love you\u201d on another TikToker\u2019s video that implied that Hailey and Kylie are \u201cmean girls\u201d and \u201cbitches.\u201d\n\n\nNew selenator alert \ud83d\udea8#selenagomez #haileybieber #kyliejenner #selenator #meangirls #nepobaby \n\n## \nAs the discourse grew, Selena announced that she will be taking a break from social media on Thursday evening. \u201cThis is a little silly,\u201d she said, alluding to the drama with Hailey. \u201cI\u2019m 30. I\u2019m too old for this.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnd as pop culture enthusiasts dissected the entire saga on social media, it wasn\u2019t long before Hailey\u2019s history of being a hardcore Belieber was brought to the forefront.\n\n\n## \nIn addition to being a massive stan of her now-husband, Hailey was also once obsessed with his relationship with Selena and would often tweet about them when she was a teenager.\n\n\n## \nSelena and Justin \u2014 who were also known as \u201cJelena\u201d \u2014 first started dating in 2011, and their on-again, off-again relationship went on for over seven years.\n\n\n## \nA few months after the two went public with their romance, a then-15-year-old Hailey tweeted:  \"I\u2019m for sure 100% team #Jelena\"\n\n\n## \nShe followed up in September with: \"I don't care what anyone says but Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez together is the definition of a teenage dream!\u201d\n\n\n## \nThe year after, she said that Selena was \u201cbeyond flawless\u201d and Jelena were the \u201cperfect relationship\u201d as she joked that she will be \u201cforever alone.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAlso in 2012, Hailey shared her disappointment that Justin and Selena did not attend the Vanity Fair Oscars party because she had been looking forward to seeing their \u201ccolor coordination.\u201d\n\n\n## \nShe wrote at the time: \u201cI gotta say I was really looking forward to seeing what color coordination Jelena was gonna do for this years VF party.. #sigh #ohwell.\u201d\n\n\n## \nHailey\u2019s Twitter account has since been deleted, and she, Selena, and Justin have never acknowledged the historical tweets.\n\n\n## \nAnd people are now giving Selena credit for not bringing them up amid her ongoing drama with Hailey.\n\n\n## \nOne person tweeted: \u201cselena better than me theres sm embarrassing shit of hailey online that she could use against her.\u201d\n\n\nselena better than me theres sm embarrassing shit of hailey online that she could use against her \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\n## \nAnother shared screenshots of Hailey\u2019s tweets and wrote: \u201cselena a better person than me bc i would've ended hailey with this.\u201d\n\n\nselena a better person than me bc i would've ended hailey with this\n\n## \nSomeone else echoed: \u201cSelena just needs to post Hailey\u2019s old Jelena tweets and that picture of her holding up the magazine, time to pick up the weapons you fight with.\u201d\n\n\nSelena just needs to post Hailey\u2019s old Jelena tweets and that picture of her holding up the magazine, time to pick up the weapons you fight with\n\n## \nOver on TikTok, one person shared a photo of Hailey holding up a copy of M magazine that has Justin and Selena on the cover.\n\n\n## \nThey wrote alongside it: \u201cselena gomez is so much better than me bc this would be my profile pic rn if i were her.\u201d\n\n\ni had to stand up for my girl \n\n## \nMany Selena fans responded by changing their own profile pictures to that photo, with one then joking: \u201cBrb gotta comment on a hailey video rq.\u201d\n\n\n## \nHailey first befriended Justin in 2014, and he was forced to deny that they were dating when he posted a selfie with her during one of his and Selena\u2019s regular breaks.\n\n\n## \nJustin and Selena\u2019s final attempt at a relationship was between November 2017 and March 2018. He reconnected with Hailey at a Miami press conference for their church just three months later.\n\n\n## \nHe proposed to Hailey one month after that, and the two got legally married in a private courthouse ceremony in September 2018 \u2014 only six months after his and Selena\u2019s most recent split, and after nearly eight years of their rocky relationship.\n\n\n## \nEver since Hailey and Justin tied the knot, her and Selena\u2019s fandoms have been at loggerheads with one another.\n\n\n## \nIn 2019, Selena appeared to ask her followers to stop targeting Hailey on social media during an Instagram Live. \u201cI do not stand for women tearing women down,\u201d she told her followers at the time. \u201cI will never, ever be by that. So please be kind to everyone. It doesn't matter what the situation is, if you're my fans, don't be rude to anybody, please.\u201d\n\n\n## \nThat same year, Hailey showed solidarity as she liked one of Selena\u2019s Instagram posts, as well as one of Elle magazine\u2019s that featured Selena as the cover star.\n\n\n## \nA source told Us Weekly at the time: \u201cIt\u2019s her way of trying to make peace and show her support for Selena in a low-key, yet public way.\u201d\n\n\n## \nBut the two women have continued to be pitted against one another, and Hailey appeared to reference the fact that she still receives nasty messages from Selena\u2019s fans in a TikTok video last year.\n\n\n## \n\u201cLeave me alone at this point. I'm minding my business,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't do anything, I don't say anything. Leave me alone please. Enough time has gone by where it's valid to leave me alone. I beg of you, truly. That's my only request. Leave me alone. Be miserable somewhere else. Please.\u201d\n\n\nthis is for you guys in my comments every single time I post\n\n## \nSelena was targeted by Hailey\u2019s fans one month later, when she was accused of shading Hailey when she posted a skincare routine video to her social media page.\n\n\n## \n\u201cGuys no idea what I did but I really am sorry. Zero bad intention. Deleting soon,\u201d Selena commented in response.\n\n\n## \nHailey then directly addressed the feud speculation on the Call Her Daddy podcast in September, where she stressed that her and Justin\u2019s relationship did not overlap with his and Selena\u2019s.\n\n\n## \n\"That was a situation where I know for a fact that it was the right thing for them to close that door; they were not in a relationship at that time,\u201d Hailey explained. \u201cBut, of course, there's a very long history there and it's not my relationship.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cI think it was the best thing that could've happened for him to move on and be engaged and get married and move on with his life in that way,\u201d she added.\n\n\n## \nShe also insisted that there is \u201cno drama\u201d between her and Selena, and that they\u2019d had a conversation that brought her \u201ca lot of peace.\u201d\n\n\n## \nHailey said at the time: \u201cThat\u2019s also why I feel like if everybody on our side knows what happened and we\u2019re good and we could walk away from it with clarity and respect, and that\u2019s fine.\"\n\n\n## \nBut given how the last week went down, it looks like this is one piece of celeb drama that won\u2019t be going away anytime soon.\n\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Alex Murdaugh\u2019s Lawyers Inadvertently \u201cOpened The Door\u201d To Evidence About His Other Alleged Crimes, A Judge Ruled\n\nProsecutors want to convince the jury that Alex Murdaugh killed his wife and son to distract from his alleged financial crimes.\n\nAlex Murdaugh (center) with defense attorneys Jim Griffin (left) and Dick Harpootlian on Wednesday.\n\nDefense attorneys for Alex Murdaugh \u201copened the door\u201d for prosecutors to introduce evidence about his other alleged crimes because they asked friends of his slain son about his character, a South Carolina judge ruled Thursday.\n\nIn a hearing without the jury present at Murdaugh\u2019s murder trial at the Colleton County courthouse, Judge Clifton Newman said he would permit prosecutors to introduce evidence about other alleged crimes that could be used to establish a possible motive for Murdaugh to have fatally shot his wife Maggie and son Paul at their rural hunting lodge on June 7, 2021.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe witness was asked whether he could think of any reason \u2026 why Mr. Murdaugh would commit the crimes he's accused of committing,\u201d Newman said. \u201cThat, in effect, turned the cross-examination of that witness from dealing with specific issues in the case to having that witness testify as a character witness for Mr. Murdaugh.\u201d\n\nCiting questions about whether Murdaugh had been a loving father and good provider, Newman said that \u201cin the court\u2019s view, that opened the door for the state to respond by asking questions as the state did.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Paul\u2019s longtime friend Rogan Gibson testified about his relationship with the Murdaughs, whom he described as a \u201csecond family,\u201d as well as his communications with Maggie and Paul on the night they were killed.\u00a0\n\nProsecutors also showed the jury a Snapchat video Paul had filmed for Gibson just minutes before he was killed in which other voices can be heard in the background. Both Gibson and Will Loving, another friend of Paul\u2019s, testified that the other voices belonged to Maggie and Alex \u2014 contradicting the defendant\u2019s alibi that he had not been with the pair in the moments before their deaths.\n\nBut in cross-examination on Wednesday, defense attorney Jim Griffin asked Gibson whether he believed Alex and Maggie had a good relationship, and if they were loving to each other and their sons. Gibson said yes.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan you think of any circumstance that you can envision, knowing them as you do, where Alex would brutally murder Paul and Maggie?\u201d Griffin also asked.\n\n\u201cNot that I can think of,\u201d Gibson replied.\u00a0\n\nWhen cross-examining Loving, Griffin also asked how he would describe Paul\u2019s relationship with his father.\n\n\u201cIt was an awesome relationship,\u201d Loving testified. \u201cIt kind of seemed like Paul was the apple of his eye.\u201d\n\nProsecutors then asked whether Loving knew about Alex\u2019s finances, the debt he was carrying, or the risk of civil discovery Alex was facing in connection with a lawsuit that had been filed against the family in connection with a fatal boat crash for which Paul had been charged with manslaughter. Loving testified he did not.\u00a0\n\nThey also then asked if Loving was aware that on the morning of the killings, Alex had been confronted by staff at the law firm where he worked about $792,000 in missing funds. After the judge overruled the defense team\u2019s objection that the question was \u201ctotally improper,\u201d Loving said he was not aware.\n\nIn addition to the murder charges to which he has pleaded not guilty, Murdaugh is facing dozens of other charges related to alleged financial thefts from clients and the law practice where he worked as an attorney. He\u2019s also accused of orchestrating a plan for an assassin to kill him after Paul and Maggie\u2019s deaths so his surviving son, Buster, could receive an insurance payout.\n\nThe state has contended that Alex killed Maggie and Paul because the house of cards he had built through his financial crimes was set to collapse given his law firm had set June 7, 2021, as the deadline for him to account for missing money. \u201cThe murders served as Murdaugh\u2019s means to shift focus away from himself and buy himself some additional time to try and prevent his financial crimes from being uncovered, which \u2014 if revealed \u2014 would have resulted in personal, legal and financial ruin,\u201d lead prosecutor Creighton Waters wrote in a December motion.\u00a0\n\nJudge Clifton Newman\n\nIn his ruling on Thursday, Judge Newman said the questions about Alex\u2019s finances from the prosecution were permitted. A criminal procedure rule typically does not allow evidence about someone\u2019s bad character to be introduced, but the judge said it was permitted here because prosecutors were trying to rebut evidence that the defense had already raised.\n\n\u201cThe defense in the case has primarily been that the defendant has such a great character that he could not possibly have committed these offenses,\u201d Newman said. \u201cThat's been a general thread from the opening statement throughout.\u201d\n\nNewman also chided Alex\u2019s defense team for objecting on the basis that the question to Loving was \u201ctotally improper,\u201d saying there was no legal basis for any such objection.\u00a0\n\nAs the prosecution prepares to call more witnesses to ask about Alex\u2019s alleged financial crimes, Newman said he would have further hearings to discuss which evidence may be admitted. (One such hearing began immediately on Thursday, when the judge excused the jury so that Jeanne Seckinger, the chief financial officer of Murdaugh\u2019s former law firm, could begin giving initial testimony.)\u00a0\n\nThe same rule of criminal procedure would allow evidence of other crimes to be admitted so long as it\u2019s being used to prove motive and not as evidence of general bad character.\n\n\u201cMy view of the evidence is that evidence of the other alleged crimes can be introduced in this case to show motive, intent, and common scheme and plan,\u201d Newman said, adding that the state should be able to pursue its theory about motive.\u00a0\n\nIn responding to Newman\u2019s decision, Griffin disputed the judge\u2019s view that the evidence they had sought from Gibson and Loving related to Alex\u2019s character.\n\n\u201cThe evidence that we presented was specifically limited to the relationship between the defendant and the victim for which he was accused of murdering,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIn our view, that is not a character witness. That's a factual issue relating to the relationship between the parties.\u201d\n\n## Alex Murdaugh\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

In fact, she alleged that Debbie would weigh her every Sunday and measure her thighs \u2014 also encouraging Jennette to drink sugar-free Red Bull and coffee to suppress her appetite.\n\n\n## \nWhen Jennette started dating in her late teens, her mom sent her slut-shaming emails and even blamed her when her cancer returned. But despite everything, Jennette was overcome with emotion when Debbie died.\n\n\n## \nIn fact, it took a long time for her to come to terms with the fact that her mom was abusive toward her, and she even stopped seeing her therapist when they suggested that this was the case.\n\n\n## \nIn addition to the way that her mom treated her, Jennette\u2019s memoir chronicled her time working on the Nickelodeon series iCarly and Sam & Cat \u2014 which were both created by Dan Schneider.\n\n\n## \nOver the years, Dan has faced serious allegations about his behavior on set and in 2018 it was reported that Nickelodeon cut ties with him following an internal investigation that found evidence of verbal abuse toward his colleagues.\n\n\n## \nDan has also been accused of sexualizing the teen stars of his shows \u2014 claims that he insisted were \u201cridiculous\u201d in an interview with the New York Times.\n\n\n## \nJennette worked with Dan for six years from the age of 15, and revealed in her memoir that when she left the network she declined Nickelodeon\u2019s offer of $300,000 \u201chush money\u201d to stop her from speaking publicly about her experiences.\n\n\n## \nReferring to Dan as \u201cThe Creator\u201d throughout her book, Jennette claimed that he supplied her with alcohol when she was under the legal drinking age in a bid to loosen her up.\n\n\n## \nShe also said that she felt like she was sexualized while starring in iCarly and that she was photographed wearing a bikini during a wardrobe fitting. The Creator is also said to have forced Jennette to repeatedly reshoot her first onscreen kiss \u2014 which was also her first kiss ever \u2014 seven times despite her being visibly uncomfortable.\n\n\n## \nJennette added that she was \u201cterrified of being looked at as a sexual being\u201d and recalled an incident when The Creator gave her a shoulder massage against her wishes.\n\n\n## \nI\u2019m Glad My Mom Died ended up being a huge success and has received critical acclaim for the powerful and raw way that Jennette openly shares her experiences with readers.\n\n\n## \nSome other former child stars have also spoken out about the way that they related to Jennette\u2019s book, including Drew Barrymore.\n\n\n## \nAnd last week, British actor Kaya Scodelario credited the memoir for helping her realize that she was also abused by her mother and \u201cscrewed\u201d by the TV industry.\n\n\n## \nKaya was 14 years old when she landed the role of Effy Stonem in the gritty TV show Skins, which aired between 2007 and 2013.\n\n\n## \nThe groundbreaking series is infamous for its bleak subject matters, graphic sex scenes, and its depiction of young teenagers indulging in drugs and alcohol, with Kaya just one of the famous names to have cut her teeth on the show.\n\n\n## \nBut in recent years, several former cast members have opened up about their negative experience on set, with some even saying that they are \u201cvictims of trauma.\u201d\n\n\n## \nKaya also spoke out last year, admitting that \u201csafeguarding really wasnt a thing back then\u201d and that starring as Effy caused her a lot of long-term \u201cissues.\u201d\n\n\n## \nDiscussing the show on TikTok, one fan asked Kaya: \u201cDo you think being on Skins affected your mentality at that age?\u201d to which the star replied: \u201cYes. It was a beautiful time but also the deep rooted cause of a lot of my issues now. Still, it gave me the opportunity to do the job I loved.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnd now she has personally reached out to thank Jennette for \u201cputting into words\" something she's \"never been able to\u201d in a moving Instagram comment.\n\n\n## \nJennette had shared a screenshot of her memoir still dominating the New York Times bestsellers list for the 20th week running. She wrote: \u201ci never could\u2019ve imagined the book would make this kind of impact. to know that literal millions (!!) of you have taken the time to read it and have connected with it so intimately\u2026 wow. i am deeply grateful.\u201d\n\n\n## \nAnd Kaya, 30, took the opportunity to make her feelings known, posting in the comment section: \u201cJennette you don\u2019t know me but I just wanted to say thank you so much for putting into words something I\u2019ve never been able to.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cThanks to you (and an amazing therapist) I now see that I had an abusive mother and was screwed by the industry,\u201d Kaya went on. \u201cYour book made me laugh and cry in a way I\u2019ve need to so badly for years.\u201d\n\n\n## \n\u201cThank you. I\u2019m sure writing it was triggering and stressful but I hope you are aware of how many people you have helped,\u201d she concluded.\n\n\n## \nKaya later called Jennette\u2019s memoir \u201cthe most important book of a generation.\u201d\n\n\n## \nKaya did not share any further information about her relationship with her mom, Katia, but she has spoken about her in the past.\n\n\n## \nKatia moved to the United Kingdom from Brazil two years before Kaya was born, and largely raised her on her own. They moved to London when Kaya was 4 years old, and spent their first night sleeping on the streets before being given temporary accommodation.\n\n\n## \nKaya\u2019s mom had clinical depression and worked multiple jobs to make ends meet; in 2017, Kaya shared her dream of repaying her mom for all that she sacrificed for her.\n\n\n## \n\u201cWhen I was growing up, we didn\u2019t have much money. What was important in my house was to have food on the table, be happy and have our family,\u201d she told the Mirror at the time. \u201cI want to give a life back to her as she gave her whole life up for me.\u201d\n\n\n## \nKaya also said that her mom was \u201cvery strict\u201d when she was growing up and that her depression strained their relationship.\n\n\n## \n\u201cWe lived in a council flat and I spent most of my time on estates. My mom was very strict. I used to hate it. But she didn\u2019t want me to get pregnant like the people around me. I always knew about sex, about drugs,\u201d Kaya said.\n\n\n## \n\u201cShe raised me alone and she suffered depression most of her life. It can be very dark, very difficult, especially as a teenager. It put a lot of pressure on our relationship,\u201d she added. \u201cI wanted to help but I was 16 and probably not saying the right thing.\u201d\n\n\n## \nMeanwhile, Kaya\u2019s fellow Skins alumni April Pearson and Laya Lewis were the first to give an insight into their \u201cfucked up\u201d experience on the show during a candid discussion on April\u2019s podcast Are You Michelle From Skins? in 2021.\n\n\n## \nThe two women admitted to feeling uncomfortable and unprotected during filming, and said that they were \u201ctoo young\u201d to be stripping their clothes on TV and shooting sex scenes.\n\n\n## \nThey also reflected on the pressure that they were under to look a certain way, with Laya claiming that they were encouraged to skip meals before the female cast members were told to line up in their bikinis so that the showrunner could approve their bodies.\n\n\n## \nApril added that almost every former cast member she\u2019d spoken to felt the same way that she and Laya did. Last month, Jack O\u2019Connell said that when he landed the role of Cook in Skins at 17 he was \u201cvery naive.\u201d\n\n\n## \nBecause of this, Jack explained that he accepted the sex and nudity as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of being on the show without stopping to question whether or not he was comfortable with it.\n\n\n## \nThe actor went on to add that while he felt \u201cvery compromised\u201d on Skins, the most important thing is that everybody learns from it so that the issues don\u2019t happen again.\n\n\n## \nSkins was created by father and son Bryan Elsley and Jamie Brittain. When Laya's and April\u2019s podcast episode was released in May 2021, Bryan\u2019s rep said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019re deeply and unambiguously sorry that any cast member was made to feel uncomfortable or inadequately respected in their work during their time on Skins. We're committed to continually evolving safe, trustworthy and enjoyable working conditions for everyone who works in the TV industry.\"\n\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

Michelle Whitaker, were fired from the Memphis Fire Department on Monday. Whitaker remained in the fire apparatus while Long and Sandridge responded to the call of a person who had been pepper-sprayed, but they failed to adequately assess Nichols's injuries, Fire Chief Gina Sweat said in a statement.\n\n\"Their actions or inactions on the scene that night do not meet the expectations of the Memphis Fire Department and are not reflective of the outstanding service the men and women of the Memphis Fire Department provide daily in our community,\" Sweat said.\n\nThe EMTs were \"relieved of duty,\" and an investigation into their response was launched, fire department spokesperson Qwanesha Ward said on Jan. 23.\n\nNichols, a 29-year-old father who was an avid skateboarder and photographer, was violently beaten by police during a traffic stop on Jan. 7. His family said that his injuries were so severe that he was unrecognizable in the hospital. Nichols died three days after the encounter.\n\nFive officers have been fired and charged with second-degree murder. A sixth officer was \"relieved of duty\" on Monday.\n\nBody camera footage of the incident that the city released on Friday has sparked angry protests across the country. But the response by EMTs at the scene and the apparent lack of urgency with which they treated Nichols have been called into question.\n\nVideo shows two EMTs arriving on the scene at 8:41 p.m. Footage from a street pole camera shows that they appear to tend to Nichols for a few brief minutes, then stand back and watch as he groans in pain on the ground and slumps over several times.\n\nA stretcher was brought out 19 minutes after the paramedics reached the scene. An ambulance arrived two minutes later.\n\nNichols was transported to the hospital in critical condition, and he died three days later. Attorneys for his family said he had \"extensive bleeding\" from the beating, citing an independent autopsy.\n\n## More on this\n\n",

        "article": "# They Used To Skate With Tyre Nichols In Middle School. They Gathered Together To Grieve Him.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to leave. What are you supposed to do after this?\u201d\n\nReporting From\n\nAn avid skateboarder, Tyre Nichols was known for helping others learn tricks and welcoming newcomers into his circle.\u00a0\n\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 It had been years since the old crew gathered at the skate park where they used to spend every day together. They trickled in as the suburban horizon glowed orange, converging with eager hugs and hesitant smiles, eyes lighting up in delayed recognition each time a new face clicked into a familiarity that had faded with time.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYo, remember me?\u201d said Cody Davidek, who had been the first to arrive at Regency Community Skatepark on Monday evening for the memorial for Tyre Nichols.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAy, wassup!\u201d replied Luke Danforth, strolling up with a skateboard in hand.\u00a0\n\nMany of them were teenagers the last time they\u2019d seen one another, more than a decade ago. Now in their late 20s and unsure of where to begin catching up, they cut straight to the headlines.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI made a family,\u201d said Anderson Williams, who wore a red T-shirt bearing screen-printed photos of Nichols and the words \u201cSkate in Peace.\u201d \u201cThree, all boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn!\u201d Danforth said.\u00a0\n\nAfter they graduated high school, the crew had gradually gone their separate ways. Some went off to college. Some moved out of state, to Arizona or Oregon or Utah. Some found new friend circles in adulthood. Some focused their time on stabilizing their careers and raising children. Williams worked for a soil company. Davidek got a job setting up Dyson displays at Best Buy. Danforth was in sustainable construction. Curtis Currier cofounded a branding agency. John Dumalig went into graphic design. Ryan Wilson became a trucker; Alex Wilson (no relation), a bike technician.\u00a0\n\nFrom left: Cody Davidek, Anderson Williams, Luke Danforth, and Alex Wilson see one another for the first time in years at the memorial for their friend\u00a0Tyre Nichols at the Regency Community Skatepark.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, now we\u2019re all busy with responsibilities and families,\u201d Alex Wilson said.\u00a0\n\nThe group of childhood friends grew larger as the evening darkened to night, until more than a dozen of them stood at the corner of the skate park, hands tucked into pockets, hoods drawn over their beanies to block the windchill. Good to see you, they all kept saying. But this was a reunion none of them could have anticipated, their divergent lives drawn together once more by their shared love for an old friend they\u2019d lost in a tragedy they were still trying to process.\n\nSpeaking the thought that crossed all of their minds, Danforth said, \u201cI wish we were together under better circumstances.\u201d\n\nUnzipping his backpack, Dumalig pulled out candles that he handed out to everyone in the crew. He was a few years older than the others and widely admired for having been the best skater of the group. He considered Nichols a \u201cyounger brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet in here, get your candles,\u201d he said to the others. \u201cWe got plenty of flame, dude.\u201d\n\nTyre Nichols\u2019s old skate crew set up candles at the park where they used to spend every day together.\u00a0\n\nAround them, the skate park was quickly filling with people. Eventually, more than 100 would show up to the memorial for Nichols, the 29-year-old killed by police officers in Memphis, where he had moved in 2020. Five officers face murder charges. A sixth has been suspended. The unit they were a part of has been disbanded. Video of the brutal beating has spread far and wide, but most of Nichols\u2019s old crew said they\u2019ve tried to avoid it. Nichols joins a long list of hashtagged names that police violence has made famous, but to the friends who\u2019d known him a long time, his death is not a rallying cry but an acute and intimate pain.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSome days, when I think about him, it hurts so much that I try to just sleep it off,\u201d Williams said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cI wish I could\u2019ve seen him more,\u201d Danforth said.\n\n\u201cWhen you get older, it\u2019s hard to stay in touch sometimes,\u201d said Alex Wilson, lighting his candle below a cupped hand to shield the breeze.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAway from the news cameras and the crowd clustering in the center of the park, the crew gathered behind a big ramp at the far edge, placing their candles in a tight circle along its base. Arms draped around one another, they huddled together over the flickering warmth, memories rushing back with a flood of nostalgia.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis place was the best, man,\u201d said Ryan Wilson, gazing around at the ramps where he first learned to skate.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnybody who showed up here was part of the family,\u201d Danforth said.\n\nDanforth and Alex Wilson had been the first in the crew to move into this subdivision in Natomas, a vast and flat Sacramento suburb spanning from the airport to the city center. When their families arrived in the early 2000s, most of the neighborhood, including Regency Park, was still under construction, part of a housing boom sweeping across the vacant grasslands north of the city.\u00a0\n\nConveniently located at the intersection of Interstates 5 and 80 \u2014 Northern California\u2019s two main arteries \u2014 Natomas offered easy access to downtown at an affordable price that lured first-time homebuyers from around the region and across a diverse range of class backgrounds and ethnicities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs more houses went up, more young families moved in to fill them. Tyre Nichols and his father arrived around five months after Danforth and Alex Wilson. The three preteens explored their unfinished neighborhood together. Some days, they traversed the wood frames of soon-to-be houses, trying to shoot each other with airsoft guns. Most days, they met up at Regency Park, which, at the time, was just fields of dirt surrounding a construction zone that workers covered with tarp when they clocked out every evening. Beneath the tarp, a skate park was taking shape. Danforth, Alex Wilson, and Nichols were all novice skateboarders, and after the construction workers would leave, they\u2019d pull off the tarps and test their moves on the freshly installed ramps and rails.\u00a0\n\nA memorial to Tyre Nichols is seen at the\u00a0Regency Community Skate Park in Sacramento on Jan. 30, 2023.\n\nSoon, grass covered the dirt, walls filled in the wood frames, and Regency Park bustled with kids who all lived within blocks of one another. The school bus dropped the neighborhood kids off at the corner, and every day around 20 of them would head straight for the skate park.\u00a0\n\nThe after-school routine persisted through rain and freezing temperatures, all through middle school and high school. On nights when the moon was full or blood red, the crew met at the park to skate under its light. After their sessions, a few of them would head to Ryan Wilson\u2019s place to play Grand Theft Auto V on Xbox. They\u2019d stay up late talking about their dreams. Ryan Wilson remembers Nichols remarking that he just hoped \u201cto find his place in this world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt started out as just skating, but when the sun goes down and you\u2019re real tired and stuff, that\u2019s when the real bond forms and the real friendship starts blossoming,\u201d Ryan Wilson said.\u00a0\n\nOn weekends and in the summer, Nichols would be back out at the park in the morning. Some kids skated more than others, but nobody skated more than Nichols. Whenever he could, he\u2019d stay out there eight hours, a fixture on the ramps, the iPod in his ears bumping music so loudly that others at the park could hear the hip-hop or metal pouring out.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe was there every single day,\u201d Danforth said. \u201cHe brought so much joy to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe always wanted to just make everyone around him smile,\u201d Ryan Wilson said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cEverybody who met him wanted to be his friend,\u201d Dumalig said.\u00a0\n\n\"Every time I'd see him, it's like, 'This kid's always so psyched, I can't be bummed,'\" said Currier, who was a few years older than Nichols and worked at a local skate shop that the crew frequented. \"It was an infectious, beautiful energy.\"\n\nIn the parks of Natomas, where some kids maintained hard exteriors and kept a skeptical distance from peers outside their friend group, Nichols stood out for his easygoing nature: quick to welcome newcomers and adept at defusing the tensions of juvenile conflicts with jokes and a relentless warmth.\u00a0\n\nThough Nichols quickly became one of the more talented skaters at the park, he was best known for his willingness to teach others. At least three members of his old crew credited him with guiding them through their first tricks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cTyre was always hyping people up,\u201d Dumalig said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you ever skated up here, you knew him,\u201d said Davidek, who wore a white T-shirt that he\u2019d written phrases on in red marker: \u201cRIP Tyre,\u201d \u201cJustice for Tyre,\u201d and \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d which Nichols had said to the police after they pulled him out of his car, recorded in bodycam footage.\u00a0\n\nNichols had been at the park the first time Davidek showed up to try to skate. Though Davidek was \u201cthe worst one out here,\u201d he said, Nichols introduced himself and helped him learn how to keep his balance.\u00a0\n\nWilliams said he first encountered Nichols when they were 12. At the time, many kids were moving into the neighborhood quickly, creating an intimidating environment of unfamiliar faces. Williams was at the park by himself watching Nichols and a few other kids skate when Nichols paused to ask if he wanted to borrow his board. The two alternated rounds up and down the ramp.\u00a0\n\nCandles are set up at a memorial for Nichols behind a skate ramp.\n\n\u201cHe just looked like a good dude, so I gave it a go,\u201d Williams said.\u00a0\n\nDuring breaks in the action, Nichols would run to the CVS down the street and return with Cheetos and Arizona Mucho Mango Tea tall cans for all his friends.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll those years, I never saw Tyre pick a fight with a single person,\u201d Danforth said.\u00a0\n\nAfter a beat, Dumalig added, \u201cUnless someone waxed the coping on the mini ramp.\u201d\n\nEverybody burst into laughter.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat mini ramp was his baby,\u201d Ryan Wilson said.\u00a0\n\nWaxing the coping on the mini ramp, which is a small half-pipe, meant making it more slippery, giving skaters a faster but riskier ride. Nichols didn\u2019t like that. He was a \u201cthoughtful skater,\u201d Alex Wilson said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t haul ass down the ramp. He had a really laid-back style.\u201d\n\nThose memories made it hard for his friends to reckon with the reality that Nichols had fallen victim to police violence. Some learned of his death on social media. Others heard about it from their parents.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at first,\u201d said Williams, who had weekly phone calls with Nichols up until the end. \u201cOf all of the kids we hung out with around here, that\u2019s the last one you\u2019d expect something like this to happen to.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was just so peaceful,\u201d Davidek said.\u00a0\n\nThe chatter came to a hush as the memorial service began. The Regency Park crew represented just one slice of an expansive life that crossed a range of social circles, leaving an impact at every stage. Aunties, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins shared stories. One sang a song. Another, a poem. Prayers were recited, memories recounted, and tears shed. Laughter rippled across the night, and blunt smoke wafted into the starry sky. More than two dozen people stepped up to the microphone to tell the world how Nichols had brought them joy. After each reflection, the skate crew tapped their boards on the ground in applause, a rhythmic clatter echoing through the park.\n\nMore than 100 people gathered at the memorial for Tyre Nichols at Regency Community Skate Park in Sacramento.\u00a0\n\nThe service lasted more than an hour, and after it wound down and the family representatives thanked the crowd for showing up, many stayed.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to leave,\u201d Danforth said. \u201cWhat are you supposed to do after this?\u201d\n\nThe old friends exchanged phone numbers, vowed to keep in touch more than they had, made vague plans to meet again soon. Dumalig told the others that a guy he knew was making a skateboard to honor Nichols. Everyone in the crew wanted one.\n\n\u201cA deluxe Tyre board,\u201d Dumalig said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going on the wall,\u201d Danforth said.\n\nSome, like Danforth and Alex Wilson, still come out to skate at Regency Park every now and then, though they live in other parts of Sacramento, a city in the midst of a renaissance. New bars line midtown. The gleaming new Downtown Commons boasts a basketball arena and a collection of restaurants. Young people priced out of the Bay Area have poured in, fueling rising housing prices and a burgeoning cultural scene.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFew in the old crew still live in Natomas, which has continued to develop over the years, blooming more subdivisions for young families to live in and more parks brimming with kids forging friendships that feel like they will last forever.\u00a0\n\nThe crowd at the memorial service slowly filtered out. Relatives put out the candles. Camera crews packed their gear. Old friends slapped hands, hugged, and began to part ways.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know all of you guys,\u201d Nichols\u2019s uncle Johnie Honeycutt said to Danforth and Alex Wilson. \u201cAnd y\u2019all were such a big part of Tyre\u2019s life. He really loved y\u2019all.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe all loved him,\u201d Danforth said.\n\nAs Ryan Wilson exited the park, he found himself overcome with emotion.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSeeing all my friends and everything\u2026\u201d He trailed off. \u201cI was getting so many hugs from so many old friends.\u201d\n\nHe thought about how easily they had drifted apart as the years passed, how swiftly plans to stay in touch can dissolve, how social media can belie the urgency to schedule that catch-up call.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how many people are reaching out to me, old friends I\u2019ve missed so freaking dearly,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this unfortunate tragedy has kind of helped rekindle some friendships that I should have taken more care of in the past.\u201d\n\nEven in death, he reflected, Nichols was bringing people together, as he had in life. \u25cf\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",

        "article": "# Sam Bankman-Fried, Founder Of The Crypto Exchange FTX, Has Pleaded Not Guilty To Fraud And Other Charges\n\nIf convicted on all counts, he faces up to 115 years in prison.\n\nInvestigations Correspondent\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, appeared in a federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon and pleaded not guilty to eight counts of defrauding customers, laundering money, and violating campaign finance laws. Bankman-Fried's trial was set for Oct. 2; if convicted of all the charges, he faces up to 115 years in prison.Bankman-Fried, 30, was arrested in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, on Dec. 12 and extradited to the US on Dec. 21. He appeared in court the following day and was released on a $250 million bail package, one of the largest in US history. Under the terms of the package, he has been confined to his parents\u2019 home in Palo Alto, California.An unsealed indictment said that the crypto entrepreneur \u201cknowingly devised\u201d a scheme to defraud his customers. A US attorney said at a press conference that FTX was \u201cone of the biggest financial frauds in US history\u201d and that Bankman-Fried used the allegedly stolen money \u201cfor his personal benefit.\u201d\n\nIn November, after investors rushed to withdraw their funds from FTX, fearing that it was about to collapse, the company declared bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried stepped down as CEO. It later emerged that the crypto exchange had been moving customer money into Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund owned by Bankman-Fried.Still, he protested that he was innocent. At the end of November, he appeared at a conference organized by the New York Times and said, \u201cI did not ever try to commit fraud on anyone.\u201d He blamed the collapse of FTX on poor record-keeping and nonexistent risk management.John Ray, the new CEO of FTX, had said that $7 billion is missing from the company. Bankman-Fried allegedly laundered the stolen funds and violated campaign finance laws by making donations in the names of other people.\n\nTwo of Bankman-Fried\u2019s key associates, FTX cofounder Gary Wang, 29, and former Alameda co-CEO Caroline Ellison, 28, have pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. Once housemates and close friends of Bankman-Fried \u2014 Ellison was reportedly romantically linked to the entrepreneur \u2014 the two are now cooperating witnesses, helping the US government\u2019s investigation of FTX. According to Ellison\u2019s unsealed plea transcript, Alameda secretly had lent billions to FTX\u2019s top leaders.\n\nAlongside the criminal investigation, Bankman-Fried faces civil complaints from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the derivatives market. In addition to seeking reparations for customers of FTX who lost their money, the agencies want to bar Bankman-Fried from acting as a director or officer of any company in the future.\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\nInvestigations Correspondent\n\n",

        "article": "# The Other Tennessee Democrat Who Was Expelled By His GOP Colleagues From His House Seat For Protesting Gun Violence Has Been Reinstated\n\n\"And so the message for all the people in Nashville who decided to expel us: You can't expel hope. You can't expel justice. You can't expel our voice.\"\n\nJustin Pearson celebrates after being reinstated to the the Tennessee House of Representatives by the Shelby County Board of Commissioners in Memphis.\n\nJustin Pearson, a Tennessee Democrat who was ousted from elected office by his Republican House colleagues for protesting gun violence in the state Capitol, was reinstated to his seat in the Tennessee House on Wednesday.\n\nThe Shelby County Board of Commissioners unanimously voted to send Pearson back to the House in a decisive rebuke of the Tennessee GOP's extraordinary move to expel him, along with another Democratic colleague, last week.\n\nPearson delivered a powerful speech right after the reinstatement vote, rallying his supporters and sending a message to the lawmakers who voted to expel him.\n\n\"What we have shown here in Shelby County, what we have shown here in Memphis, Tennessee, with my fianc\u00e9, my brothers, my family, my parents, my family here, is that we do not speak alone,\" Pearson said. \"We speak together. We fight together.\n\n\"And so the message for all the people in Nashville who decided to expel us: You can't expel hope. You can't expel justice. You can't expel our voice. And you sure can't expel our fight,\" he said to cheers.\n\n\"We look forward to continuing to fight, continuing to advocate, until justice rolls down like water and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream,\" Pearson continued. \"Let's get back to work.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old lawmaker was sworn in on Thursday morning outside the state Capitol.\n\nPearson, who represents the Memphis area, and another Democrat, Justin Jones, who represents Nashville, were expelled from the House on Thursday for protesting gun violence after three 9-year-olds and three adults were killed in yet another mass shooting in Tennessee. Rep. Gloria Johnson, a Democrat who also participated in the protest, survived expulsion by a single vote. Pearson and Jones are young Black men serving their first term in the House; Johnson is a white woman in her fourth term.\n\nRepublicans had accused them of a grave breach of decorum in the House by protesting peacefully, and House Speaker Cameron Sexton went so far as to liken their actions to the violent Jan. 6 insurrection, even though there was no violence, no property damage, and no arrests.\n\nJones was reinstated to his seat by the Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County on Monday. Surrounded by a swarm of supporters, Jones then marched back to the Statehouse and was sworn into office on the steps of the Capitol.\n\nState Rep. Justin Jones (center), with his fist in the air, marches with supporters to the state Capitol on April 10, 2023, in Nashville after being appointed back to his seat in the state House by the Metro Nashville City Council.\n\nPearson's and Jones's appointments this week are on an interim basis, and they will have to run for their seats again in a special election to carry out the term. Both men have said they will do so.\n\nTheir expulsions \u2014 which effectively disenfranchised approximately 140,000 constituents, mostly Black and brown, in the two districts that elected them \u2014 were widely criticized by Tennesseans and lawmakers.\n\nOn Wednesday, five Demoratic US senators urged the Department of Justice to investigate whether the Tennessee state legislature violated any constitutional or civil rights laws when it expelled Jones and Pearson. Sens. Raphael Warnock, Chuck Schumer, Chris Murphy, Alex Padilla, and Brian Schatz wrote their expulsions \"overturn and subvert the will\" of voters in Nashville and Memphis.\n\n\"People of all goodwill in Tennessee and across America and are deeply disturbed by these counter-democratic expulsions because they overturn and subvert the will of Tennessee voters in Nashville and Memphis,\" they wrote. \"Many in the Tennessee legislature appear to have convinced themselves that The People\u2019s House is their house, and they have effectively evicted the districts\u2019 voters out of their own house. This is un-democratic, un-American, and unacceptable, and the US Department of Justice should investigate whether it was also unlawful or unconstitutional.\"\n\n## More on this\n\n",

        "article": "# Celine Dion Fans Protested Outside Rolling Stone's Offices After She Was Excluded From The \"Greatest Singers Of All Time\" List\n\nAndrea Bocelli, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Cher, Nat King Cole, and Judy Garland were also excluded.\n\nCeline Dion performs \"My Heart Will Go On\" at the Billboard Music Awards in 2017.\n\nA group of Celine Dion fans protested outside Rolling Stone's office in New York on Friday after the publication excluded her from its \"200 Greatest Singers of All Time\" list.\n\nRolling Stone's list, which sparked outrage online after it was published on New Year's Day, included singers Aretha Franklin, Taylor Swift, Rosal\u00eda, Ozzy Osbourne, and Beyonc\u00e9, but excluded artists such as Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Cher, Nat King Cole, and Judy Garland.\n\nOne Dion fan outside of the Rolling Stone office on Friday said that they were there to express themselves \"in the name of Celine\" because the publication \"made a big mistake forgetting her name.\"\n\nAccording to Variety, the group of protesters was made up of around 15 Dion fans who traveled more than six hours from Montreal to New York City.\n\nCeline Dion fans protesting outside the Rolling Stone offices for leaving her off its 200 best singers list. Happy Friday!\n\nLast week, Dion fans expressed their outrage online after the publication snubbed the five-time Grammy winner, who has sold more than 250 million albums worldwide throughout her four-decade career.\n\n\"Respectfully, not including Celine Dion, arguably the best vocal technician of all time in this list, is borderline treasonous,\" one Twitter user said.\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone, the list was compiled by its staffers and key contributors, and \"encompasses 100 years of pop music as an ongoing global conversation.\" The decisions, the introduction to the list says, were based on \"originality, influence, the depth of an artist's catalog, and the breadth of their musical legacy.\"\n\n\"Before you start scrolling (and commenting), keep in mind that this is the Greatest Singers list, not the Greatest Voices List,\" the magazine added. \"Talent is impressive; genius is transcendent. Sure, many of the people here were born with massive pipes, perfect pitch, and boundless range. Others have rougher, stranger, or more delicate instruments.\"\n\n## More on this\n\n## Topics in this article\n\n",
