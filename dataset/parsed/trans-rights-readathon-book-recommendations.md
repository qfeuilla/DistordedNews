# 15 Books By Trans Authors To Read During The Trans Rights Readathon

The Trans Rights Readathon is happening this week. Support trans authors by donating to trans rights organization and checking out these great books.

On March 20, the Trans Rights Readathon kicked off across social platforms, a decentralized fundraiser for trans rights organizations led by author and activist Sim Kern. The readathon challenges people to spend the week reading books written by trans and nonbinary authors, while asking their communities to pledge and support them in donating to trans rights groups like the Trans Health Legal Fund or local fundraisers to support their own trans friends. 

Anyone can participate in the Trans Rights Readathon by signing up through this form and then using their platform, whether it be TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, Twitch, YouTube, or something else, to post about the books they’re reading and seek pledges. 

Kern says they launched the readathon in direct response to recent legislative efforts that are proliferating across the country. 

“I was feeling so much despair about the barrage of anti-trans bills being proposed across the U.S.,” they told Publishers Weekly. “I think so many people, myself included, felt defeated and overwhelmed and not sure what to do.”

If you’d like to participate in the Trans Rights Readathon but aren’t sure what you want to read, here are 16 recommendations of books by trans authors — memoir, YA contemporary, magical realism, romance, and more.

Happy reading!

I Keep My Exoskeletons to Myself  by Marisa Crane


In this speculative novel, Kris is not ready to be a single parent, but it is the reality she’s dealing with after her partner, Beau, dies in childbirth. 

Life is already tough as it is, since Kris is a Shadester: someone who has been deemed a wrongdoer by the state, tried for their sins by the Department of Balance, and ordered to live under constant surveillance, with designated grocery store days and dozens of other restrictions that make her feel othered.

Even Kris’s kid is a Shadester, a title given to her upon her birth because of the circumstances. Shunned by society and painfully alone, Kris is left to raise this baby on her own, all the while terrified that she’ll screw it up. But as the kid grows, she comes into herself, lit with a spark that the world can’t take away, despite all the injustice.

A thought-provoking and gorgeously written novel, I Keep My Exoskeletons to Myself is a stunning debut from Marisa Crane.

Heartstopper Vol. 1–4 by Alice Oseman


Oseman’s beloved graphic novel series is a fan favorite for many reasons: it centers queer and trans love and joy, and its characters stand up for each other and themselves to any and all bullies. 

At the heart of Heartstopper is Charlie Spring, a gay 16-year-old who, after a year of bullying, is starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel, thanks to the close friends who support him and a new boy in school who is nice to look at and talk to. Nick is confused by his feelings for Charlie, but he knows he wants to protect him, and he does just that. 

Meanwhile, Tao is upset that people in his friend group are getting coupled up, and he misses his best friend, Elle, who transferred to an all-girls school after coming out as trans. Everyone else sees what Tao can’t: he loves Elle, and not just as a friend.

While joy is at the center of Oseman’s books, there are tough topics, too, like homophobia, fraught relationships with parents, and struggles with mental health, all of which make the series more realistic and offer new ways for the characters to show compassion to each other.

Fierce Femmes and Notorious Liars: A Dangerous Trans Girl’s Confabulous Memoir by Kai Cheng Thom

The Death of Vivek Oji by Akwaeke Emezi


This prolific author’s second novel for adults, about a gender-questioning boy named Vivek Oji who lives in Southeastern Nigeria, is a moving, elegiac ode to found community.

Flitting between the perspectives of Vivek’s parents (the strict Chika, the loving Kavita), Vivek’s cousin Osita, and Vivek himself, the novel describes his troubled history growing up in the town of Ngwa; his refusal to adhere to strict gender norms; and his ragtag group of queer friends, adolescent children of the Nigerwives, a group of foreign women who are married to Nigerian men and have formed a little community. 

Emezi is an engaging and evocative writer; their descriptions of small-town Nigerian life are vividly rendered. Though the book’s title foreshadows its ending, that it still manages to move you is a testament to Emezi’s skill. —Tomi Obaro

Redefining Realness: My Path to Womanhood, Identity, Love & So Much More by Janet Mock


Writer and trans activist Janet Mock’s 2014 memoir is an honest and eye-opening portrayal of her life as a Black and Indigenous trans woman who was confident in her gender identity at a young age, but was limited by her circumstances. The first person in her family to go to college, Mock found success as a writer and editor for magazines, while keeping her guard up about her past, until she finally found the strength to come out publicly, which didn’t go as planned.

Mock shares about her parents’ marriage and its dissolution, which forced her to relocate from Hawaii to Texas as a teenager; finding her femininity among friends; her gender-affirming surgery as a college freshman. She also writes of her time as a sex worker, which she speaks on with a nuanced point of view that is valuable in any time, but especially today.
